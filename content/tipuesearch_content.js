Ports allow for information to flow into or out of the computer as part of the input and output subsystems. External devices, such as keyboards, mice, printers, scanners, storage devices, monitors, and others can connect to the computer through various types of cables, which connect to specific ports. On most modern systems, this has been reduced down to a common, standard interface, the universal serial bus port (USB port). Older systems have various ports for various functions, which are now referred to as legacy ports, such as PS/2, serial, and parallel ports. They were difficult to configure and required hardware resources to be dedicated to them, such as interrupt requests, direct memory access, and specific I/O (input/output) port addresses. In USB, this is all handled by the operating system automatically. This makes hardware conflicts rare in current systems. Many customers will still have computers with legacy ports. So, it is important to understand multiple ports and connections. \n The photo below offers a close-up view of a motherboard’s port cluster. \n 外圍設備通過標準端口連接到計算機。端口允許信息作為輸入和輸出子系統的一部分流入或流出電腦。外部設備（例如鍵盤，鼠標，印刷機，掃描儀，存儲設備，監視器和其他設備）可以通過連接到特定端口的各種類型的電纜連接到電腦。在大多數現代系統上，這已簡化為通用的標準接口，即通用串行總線端口（USB端口）。較舊的系統具有用於各種功能的各種端口，這些端口現在稱為傳統端口，例如PS / 2，串行和並行端口。它們很難配置，並且需要專用於它們的硬件資源，例如中斷請求，直接內存訪問和特定的I / O（輸入/輸出）端口地址。在USB中，這全部由操作系統自動處理。這使得在當前系統中很少發生硬件衝突。許多客戶仍將擁有帶有舊端口的電腦。因此，了解多個端口和連接很重要。 \n \n \n \n \n \n PORT \n 部位 \n \n \n NAME \n 名稱 \n \n \n FUNCTION \n 作用 \n \n \n \n \n A \n \n \n PS/2 \n \n \n Used to connect keyboards and mice. \n 用於連接鍵盤和鼠標。 \n \n \n \n \n B \n \n \n USB \n \n \n Used to connect external devices with a\xa0 universal serial bus \xa0(USB) connector, such as mice, keyboards, printers, and storage devices. \n 用於通過通用串行總線（USB）連接器連接外部設備，例如鼠標，鍵盤，打印機和存儲設備。 \n \n \n \n \n C \n \n \n S/PDIF Optical \n \n \n Used to connect digital high-fidelity audio systems. \n 用於連接數位高保真音頻系統。 \n \n \n \n \n D \n \n \n HDMI \n \n \n Used to connect a\xa0 high-definition multimedia interface\xa0 (HDMI). \n 用於連接高清多媒體接口 \n \n \n \n \n E \n \n \n VGA \n \n \n Used to connect a\xa0 video graphics array\xa0 (VGA) display device. \n 用於連接視頻圖形陣列（VGA）顯示設備 \n \n \n \n \n F \n \n \n DVI \n \n \n Used to connect a\xa0 digital video interface\xa0 (DVI) display device. \n 用於連接數位視頻接口（DVI）顯示設備。 \n \n \n \n \n G \n \n \n USB \n \n \n Used to connect external devices with a\xa0 universal serial bus \xa0(USB) connector, such as mice, keyboards, printers, and storage devices. \n 用於通過通用串行總線（USB）連接器連接外部設備，例如鼠標，鍵盤，打印機和存儲設備。 \n \n \n \n \n H \n \n \n IEEE 1394 \n \n \n Used to connect external FireWire devices, such as hard drives and cameras. \n 用於連接外部FireWire設備，例如硬盤驅動器和相機 \n \n \n \n \n I \n \n \n RJ-45 \n \n \n Used to connect to an Ethernet network. \n 用於連接到以太網路 \n \n \n \n \n J \n \n \n USB \n \n \n Used to connect external devices with a\xa0 universal serial bus \xa0(USB) connector, such as mice, keyboards, printers, and storage devices. \n 用於通過通用串行總線（USB）連接器連接外部設備，例如鼠標，鍵盤，打印機和存儲設備。 \n \n \n \n \n K \n \n \n Audio \n \n \n Used to connect to a speaker system. \n 用於連接揚聲器系統。 \n \n \n \n \n PORT \n 部位 \n NAME \n 名稱 \n FUNCTION \n 作用 \n A \n PS/2 \n Used to connect keyboards and mice. \n 用於連接鍵盤和鼠標。 \n B \n USB \n Used to connect external devices with a\xa0 universal serial bus \xa0(USB) connector, such as mice, keyboards, printers, and storage devices. \n 用於通過通用串行總線（USB）連接器連接外部設備，例如鼠標，鍵盤，打印機和存儲設備。 \n C \n S/PDIF Optical \n Used to connect digital high-fidelity audio systems. \n 用於連接數位高保真音頻系統。 \n D \n HDMI \n Used to connect a\xa0 high-definition multimedia interface\xa0 (HDMI). \n 用於連接高清多媒體接口 \n E \n VGA \n Used to connect a\xa0 video graphics array\xa0 (VGA) display device. \n 用於連接視頻圖形陣列（VGA）顯示設備 \n F \n DVI \n Used to connect a\xa0 digital video interface\xa0 (DVI) display device. \n 用於連接數位視頻接口（DVI）顯示設備。 \n G \n USB \n Used to connect external devices with a\xa0 universal serial bus \xa0(USB) connector, such as mice, keyboards, printers, and storage devices. \n 用於通過通用串行總線（USB）連接器連接外部設備，例如鼠標，鍵盤，打印機和存儲設備。 \n H \n IEEE 1394 \n Used to connect external FireWire devices, such as hard drives and cameras. \n 用於連接外部FireWire設備，例如硬盤驅動器和相機 \n I \n RJ-45 \n Used to connect to an Ethernet network. \n 用於連接到以太網路 \n J \n USB \n Used to connect external devices with a\xa0 universal serial bus \xa0(USB) connector, such as mice, keyboards, printers, and storage devices. \n 用於通過通用串行總線（USB）連接器連接外部設備，例如鼠標，鍵盤，打印機和存儲設備。 \n K \n Audio \n Used to connect to a speaker system. \n 用於連接揚聲器系統。 \n \n \n \n \n \n CONNECTOR \n \n \n NAME \n \n \n FUNCTION \n \n \n \n \n A \n \n \n DB-9 serial \n \n \n Used for serial devices such as a mouse or external modem. \n 用於串行設備，例如鼠標或外部調製解調器。 \n \n \n \n \n B \n \n \n DB-25 parallel \n \n \n Used to connect printers. \n 用於連接印刷機。 \n \n \n \n \n C \n \n \n DB-15\xa0 (two rows of pin receptacles) \n \n \n Used to connect joysticks or\xa0 musical instrument digital interface\xa0 (MIDI) devices. \n 用於連接操縱桿或樂器數字接口（MIDI）設備。 \n \n \n \n \n D \n \n \n High-density DB-15\xa0 (three rows of pins) \n \n \n Used to connect a\xa0 video graphics array \xa0(VGA) and\xa0 super VGA \xa0(SVGA) display device. \n 用於連接視頻圖形陣列（VGA）和超級VGA（SVGA）顯示設備。 \n \n \n \n \n E \n \n \n DVI video \n \n \n Used to connect a\xa0 digital video interface (DVI) \xa0display monitor. \n 用於連接數字視頻接口（DVI）顯示監視器。 \n \n \n \n \n F \n \n \n 6-pin mini-DIN \n \n \n Used for PS/2 keyboards and mice.

In fact, USB can connect virtually any device to a computer, in modern devices. \n USB \n 通用串行總線（USB）取代了現代計算機上的許多外部輸入和輸出端口。 實際上，在現代設備中，USB幾乎可以將任何設備連接到計算機。 \n Things such as mice and keyboards, which used to use PS/2 or serial ports, now use USB. Things like printers and scanners, which once used parallel or SCSI ports, now use USB as well. Small computer system interface (SCSI) is a set of parallel interface standards developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for attaching printers, disk drives, scanners and other peripherals to computers. SCSI (pronounced "skuzzy") is supported by all major operating systems. USB began with version 1.1, which provided two speeds of operations: low-speed (1.5 Mbps for input devices such as mice/keyboards) and full-speed (12 Mbps for other devices, such as webcams, digital cameras, scanners, and printers). USB 2.0 further increased speed to what is known as high-speed or hi-speed (480 Mbps), allowing for USB to provide faster access to external storage devices such as hard drives, helping to replace SCSI and FireWire ports. USB 3.0, the current version, is known as superspeed, because it provides up to 5 Gbps of bandwidth for very fast access to external devices and can be identified by the blue color. Newer versions of USB are backward compatible with older versions, but you should not connect different versions of USB on the same port, as this slows the port down to the lowest version. For example, if you plug in a four-port USB hub to a USB 3.0 port, but then connect a USB 1.1 mouse to the hub, the entire four-port hub will now run at a maximum speed of 12 Mbps (USB 1.1 speeds). Each USB port can be daisy-chained to provide up to 127 devices per port, using USB hubs. \n 鼠標和鍵盤等以前使用PS / 2或串行端口的設備現在使用USB。曾經使用並行或SCSI端口的打印機和掃描儀之類的東西現在也使用USB。小型計算機系統接口（SCSI）是由美國國家標準協會（ANSI）開發的一組並行接口標準，用於將印刷機，磁盤驅動器，掃描儀和其他外圍設備連接到電腦。所有主要操作系統都支持SCSI（讀作“ skuzzy”）。 USB從版本1.1開始，提供兩種運行速度：低速（對於鼠標/鍵盤等輸入設備為1.5 Mbps）和全速（對於網絡攝像頭，數碼相機，掃描儀和打印機等其他設備為12 Mbps） ）。 USB 2.0將速度進一步提高到所謂的高速或高速（480 Mbps），從而使USB可以更快地訪問外部存儲設備（例如硬盤驅動器），從而幫助替換SCSI和FireWire端口。當前版本的USB 3.0被稱為超高速，因為它提供高達5 Gbps的帶寬，可以非常快速地訪問外部設備，並且可以通過藍色識別。較新版本的USB向後兼容較舊版本的USB，但是您不應在同一端口上連接不同版本的USB，因為這會將端口速度降低到最低版本。例如，如果將四端口USB集線器插入USB 3.0端口，然後將USB 1.1鼠標連接到集線器，則整個四端口集線器現在將以12 Mbps的最大速度運行（USB 1.1速度）。每個USB端口都可以使用USB集線器進行菊花鏈連接，以每個端口提供多達127個設備。 \n \n USB cables should be kept under three meters (approximately nine feet) in length for USB 1.1 and 3.0. For the USB 2.0 variant, you can use cables up to five meters (approximately 15 feet) without issues. If you use cables longer than the recommended length, you may get errors in your input/output over USB, so it is best to keep the USB cables short. If you need a longer cable run, you must use a hub as a repeater to help boost the power signal over the USB cable. There are two types of hubs: self-powered and bus-powered. Self-powered hubs have their own power adapter and connect to the wall outlet to provide power to the hub. Bus-powered are instead powered solely from the source USB port that they are connected to on the computer. This provides minimal amperage for the devices connected to the USB hub that can cause issues when connecting multiple hubs to each other. For connection of multiple hubs, it is best practice to use self-powered hubs. Each USB port can support up to 127 different devices in the chain, with the root hub for the computer having two ports directly connected to the motherboard. If you need more USB ports, you can do this by adding hubs (self-powered or bus-powered), using motherboard USB header cables, or adding expansion cards that contain more USB ports. \n 對於USB 1.1和3.0，USB電纜的長度應保持在三米（約9英尺）以下。對於USB 2.0版本，您可以使用最長5米（約15英尺）的電纜而不會出現問題。如果使用的電纜長度超過建議的長度，則通過USB的輸入/輸出可能會出現錯誤，因此最好使USB電纜的長度短。如果需要較長的電纜，則必須使用集線器作為中繼器，以幫助增強USB電纜上的電源信號。集線器有兩種類型：自供電和總線供電。自供電的集線器具有自己的電源適配器，並連接至壁裝電源插座，以為集線器供電。總線供電僅由它們在計算機上連接的源USB端口供電。這為連接到USB集線器的設備提供了最小的電流強度，當將多個集線器相互連接時會引起問題。對於連接多個集線器，最佳做法是使用自供電集線器。每個USB端口可在鏈中最多支持127個不同的設備，計算機的根集線器具有直接連接到主板的兩個端口。如果需要更多USB端口，可以通過添加集線器（自供電或總線供電），使用主板USB接頭連接器電纜或添加包含更多USB端口的擴展卡來實現。 \n \n PS/2 \n PS/2 ports, also known as mini-DIN ports, were commonly used for keyboards and mice until the past decade. Recently, these ports have been replaced by USB in most machines. These ports, though, are color-coded for the device which they are intended to be used with. The keyboard port is colored purple, and the mouse port is colored green. Even though these ports look identical, they are not interchangeable. If you plug a mouse into the keyboard port, it simply won’t work. Additionally, unlike USB, these ports are not hot-swappable. Instead, you must restart the machine after plugging the device in for the computer to recognize the new mouse or keyboard. \n PS / 2 \n PS / 2端口，也稱為mini-DIN端口，在過去十年中一直廣泛用於鍵盤和鼠標。最近，在大多數機器中，這些端口已被USB取代。但是，這些端口已針對要使用的設備進行了顏色編碼。 鍵盤端口為紫色，鼠標端口為綠色。 即使這些端口看起來相同，也不能互換。如果將鼠標插入鍵盤端口，則根本無法使用。 此外，與USB不同，這些端口不可熱插拔。 而是必須在插入設備後重新啟動機器，計算機才能識別新的鼠標或鍵盤。 \n \n p.16 \n SCSI and FireWire \n SCSI和FireWire \n FireWire \n FireWire was originally developed and made popular by Apple as a challenger to USB and a replacement for SCSI. FireWire is a high-speed, bidirectional, serial transmission port used to connect PCs to each other, or devices to PCs. It was introduced during the days of USB 1.1 as a faster alternative, since USB 1.1 had a maximum speed of 12 Mbps and FireWire has a maximum speed of 400 Mbps under IEEE 1394a (FireWire 400) and 800 Mbps under IEEE 1394b (Firewire 800). Common uses for FireWire were to connect to external storage devices and digital media devices, such as video cameras. Most FireWire devices have two FireWire ports to allow for daisy-chaining of the devices, which supports up to 16 devices per FireWire port without any degradation. FireWire remains popular with Mac OS X, but has lost much of its popularity with the introduction of USB 3.0, since the speed is much quicker with USB 3.0. \n FireWire最初是由Apple開發並流行為USB的挑戰者和SCSI的替代品。 FireWire是一個高速雙向串行傳輸端口，用於將PC彼此連接，或將設備連接至PC。 由於USB 1.1的最高速度為12 Mbps，而FireWire在IEEE 1394a（FireWire 400）下為400 Mbps，在IEEE 1394b（Firewire 800）下為800 Mbps，因此它是USB 1.1的最快替代產品。 。 FireWire的常見用途是連接到外部存儲設備和數字媒體設備，例如攝像機。 大多數FireWire設備都有兩個FireWire端口，以實現設備的菊花鏈連接，每個FireWire端口最多可支持16個設備，而不會降低性能。 FireWire在Mac OS X上仍然很流行，但是由於USB 3.0的速度要快得多，因此在引入USB 3.0時已經失去了很多流行性。 \n \n SCSI \n SCSI stands for small computer systems interface, and is a legacy type of connector. It is used to connect hard disk drives, tape drives, ZIP drives, JAZ drives, scanners, optical drives (CD/DVD), and printers to a computer both internally and externally. SCSI is found mainly in servers for hard disk drives and tape drives, but was sometimes found in older workstations in the 1990s. SCSI supports daisy-chaining and was the precursor to FireWire. SCSI can be narrow (supporting up to seven devices on a single port) or wide (supporting up to 15 devices on a single port). SCSI also requires that a unique ID be assigned to each device in the chain, so the computer knows which device is which. This is accomplished using either a DIP switch or jumper that assigns a unique ID of 0-15 (for wide), or 0-7 (for narrow). Finally, each chain must have a termination plug to signify the end of the SCSI chain. SCSI chains can contain many devices of mixed speeds, but this causes the whole “chain” to default to the slowest device. Speed for SCSI ranges from 10 Mbps to 320 Mbps. Since the advent of FireWire, SCSI has lost popularity as an external port for storage devices. Internally, SCSI has been replaced by the SATA[KK1] connector, which we will discuss in the section on storage later in the course. \n SCSI代表小型電腦系統接口，並且是舊版連接器。它用於將硬盤驅動器，磁帶驅動器，ZIP驅動器，JAZ驅動器，掃描儀，光盤驅動器（CD / DVD）和印刷機內部和外部連接到計算機。 SCSI主要在用於硬盤驅動器和磁帶驅動器的服務器中找到，但有時在1990年代在較舊的工作站中也可以找到。 SCSI支持菊花鏈，並且是FireWire的前身。 SCSI可以很窄（在單個端口上最多支持七個設備）或很寬（在單個端口上最多支持15個設備）。 SCSI還要求將唯一的ID分配給鏈中的每個設備，以便電腦知道哪個設備是哪個設備。這可以通過使用DIP開關或跳線來完成，該開關將唯一ID分配為0-15（對於寬）或0-7（對於窄）。最後，每個鏈必須有一個端接插頭以表示SCSI鏈的末端。 SCSI鏈可能包含許多混合速度的設備，但這會導致整個“鏈”默認為最慢的設備。 SCSI的速度範圍從10 Mbps到320 Mbps。自FireWire出現以來，SCSI作為存儲設備的外部端口已不再流行。在內部，SCSI已由SATA [KK1]連接器取代，我們將在本課程稍後的存儲部分中討論該連接器。 \n \n \n p.17 \n Serial and Parallel Ports \n 串行和並行端口 \n Serial ports \n Serial ports, also known as COM or RS-232 ports, were used heavily in the 1980s and 1990s for serial communication as input/output ports. They were often used for external modems, mice, trackballs, touchpads, plotters, label printers, dot-matrix printers, PDA (Palm Pilot) docking stations, digital cameras, and PC-to-PC connections. USB has replaced serial ports for all of these uses in modern computers, but some people still have a need for a serial port. If your computer doesn’t have a serial port (which is very common in modern machines), you can add one using an expansion card or a USB to serial adapter. Serial ports come in two varieties: DB-25 (containing 25 pins) and DB-9 (containing nine pins). The DB-9 variety is the most common in use. Serial ports are generally slow, since they send data one bit at a time over the wire. There is no standard serial cable pinout; instead, they are created for the application they are used for, such as a null-modem cable to connect two computers directly, or a modem cable to connect the computer to an external modem. The most common variety of serial cable in use today is the CISCO rollover cable, which has a nine-pin serial port on one end and an RJ-45 connector (like a network cable) on the other end. This cable is used to connect a computer to a CISCO router or switch for configuration tasks. \n 串行端口，也稱為COM或RS-232端口，在1980年代和1990年代被大量用於串行通信，作為輸入/輸出端口。它們通常用於外部調製解調器，鼠標，軌跡球，觸摸板，繪圖儀，標籤印刷機，點矩陣印刷機，PDA（Palm Pilot）擴展塢，數碼相機以及PC到PC的連接。 USB已取代了現代計算機中所有這些用途的串行端口，但是有些人仍然需要串行端口。如果您的電腦沒有串行端口（這在現代計算機中很常見），則可以使用擴展卡或USB到串行適配器添加一個。串行端口有兩種：DB-25（包含25個引腳）和DB-9（包含9個引腳）。 DB-9品種是最常用的品種。串行端口通常很慢，因為它們一次通過有線發送數據一位。沒有標準的串行電纜引出線。相反，它們是針對用於它們的應用程序創建的，例如直接連接兩台電腦的零調製解調器電纜，或用於將電腦連接到外部調製解調器的調製解調器電纜。當今使用的最常見的串行電纜是CISCO翻轉電纜，其一端有一個9針串行端口，而另一端有一個RJ-45連接器（如網絡電纜）。該電纜用於將電腦連接到CISCO路由器或交換機以執行配置任務。 \n \n \n Parallel ports \n Parallel ports, also known as LPT (line printer terminal) ports, were used heavily in the 1980s and 1990s for parallel communication as input/output ports. They were often used for printers and scanners. USB has replaced parallel ports for all of these uses in modern computers, and few people will still have a need for a parallel port in contemporary computing. If your computer doesn’t have a parallel port (which is very common in modern machines), you could add one using an expansion card or a USB to parallel adapter. Parallel ports come in a standard DB-25 (containing 25 pins) cable. Other varieties of cables exist, including a DB-25 to Centronics 36-pin cable (common with printers), DB-25 to DB-25 cable (common with switchboxes), and DB-25 to DB-25 with the transmit/receive pins reversed (common for computer to computer connections for data transfer). Parallel ports are generally faster than serial ports, since they send data in parallel with eight bits at a time going over the wire. Parallel ports can be configured as output only or bidirectional ports. The ports are also configured as EPP (enhanced parallel port), ECP (enhanced capabilities port), and EPP/ECP. Under EPP, the port uses interrupt request (IRQ) and I/O addresses for fastest speeds. In ECP, the port can support daisy-chaining of devices and uses IRQ, I/O address, and DMA channels, and is considered resource hungry. EPP/ECP combines both modes into a single configuration, allowing for maximum compatibility. Parallel ports transmit data at up to two Mbps and receive data at 500 Kbps, which is very slow by today’s standards. \n 並行端口，也稱為LPT（行式印刷機終端）端口，在1980年代和1990年代大量用於並行通信，作為輸入/輸出端口。它們通常用於印刷機和掃描儀。 USB已經取代了並行端口，可用於現代電腦中的所有這些用途，而當代電腦中仍然很少有人需要並行端口。如果您的電腦沒有並行端口（這在現代電腦中很常見），則可以使用擴展卡或USB到並行適配器添加一個。並行端口採用標準的DB-25（包含25針）電纜。還存在其他種類的電纜，包括DB-25至Centronics 36針電纜（與印刷機共用），DB-25至DB-25電纜（與配電箱共用）以及具有發送/接收功能的DB-25至DB-25引腳接反（電腦到電腦的連接通常用於數據傳輸）。並行端口通常比串行端口快，因為並行端口一次通過8位並行發送數據。並行端口可以配置為僅輸出端口或雙向端口。這些端口還配置為EPP（增強型並行端口），ECP（增強功能端口）和EPP / ECP。在EPP下，端口使用中斷請求（IRQ）和I / O地址以獲得最快的速度。在ECP中，端口可以支持設備的菊花鏈連接，並使用IRQ，I / O地址和DMA通道，並且被認為是資源匱乏。 EPP / ECP將兩種模式組合為一個配置，以實現最大的兼容性。並行端口以高達2 Mbps的速率發送數據，並以500 Kbps的速率接收數據，按照當今的標準，這是非常慢的。 \n \n \n \n p.19 \n Introduction \n 介紹 \n This lesson covers the basic procedures and safety precautions with which technicians must be competent and comfortable before working on various PC hardware. First we will discuss the hazards of computer systems and tools, including electricity, electrostatic discharge (ESD), chemicals, and other dangers that can hurt you when you are working on the various forms of computer hardware. We will also cover the safety measures and procedures that you must employ to minimize risk, such as using ESD straps, ESD mats, self-grounding systems, and equipment grounding. We will then discuss personal safety, including removal of jewelry to protect yourself and computers, proper lifting techniques and weight limitations, and removal of electrical power. Finally, we will cover electrical fire safety, cathode ray tube (CRT) safety and disposal, cable management, and local government regulation compliance. \n 本課程涵蓋了基本程序和安全預防措施，技術人員在使用各種PC硬件之前必須具備一定的能力和舒適度。 首先，我們將討論電腦系統和工具的危害，包括電流，靜電釋放（ESD），化學物質以及在使用各種形式的電腦硬件時可能傷害您的其他危害。 我們還將介紹必須使用以最小化風險的安全措施和程序，例如使用ESD皮帶，ESD墊，自接地系統和設備接地。 然後，我們將討論人身安全，包括為保護自己和電腦而移走珠寶，適當的舉陞技術和重量限制以及移去電源。 最後，我們將涵蓋電氣消防安全，陰極射線管（CRT）安全和處置，電纜管理以及地方政府法規合規性。 \n \n p.20 \n Operational Procedures: Electrical Safety \n 操作步驟：電氣安全 \n Electricity is a significant hazard in working with computer systems and tools. Electricity is required to make workstations operate, but if you are not careful, electricity can cause serious injury to you and major damage to the computer you are working on. \n With regard to human injury, technicians can receive an electrical shock from computers or electrical outlets if special care is not taken when working with them. It is important to check all the power outlets to ensure they are working properly. When checking the outlets, you should verify that the outlet is providing the correct amount of power. If you are working in the United States, then you should expect to receive a voltage of 115 VAC to 120 VAC (volts of alternating current) from the power outlets in an office or home. This can be verified using a simple three-prong tester, voltmeter, or multimeter. Procedurally, you must never pull the cords out by the wires, as this can cause damage and fraying of the cables. Instead, you should plug in and remove cables by the plug on the end of the cord. It is important that you never use a frayed or damaged power cable \n 電力是使用電腦系統和工具的重大危險。要使工作站正常工作，必須通電，但是如果不小心，電流可能會對您造成嚴重傷害並嚴重損害正在使用的計算機。 \n 關於人身傷害，如果在操作電腦或電源插座時未特別注意，則技術人員可能會從電腦或電源插座中遭受電擊。檢查所有電源插座以確保它們正常工作很重要。檢查插座時，應驗證插座是否提供了正確的電量。如果您在美國工作，則應該期望從辦公室或家庭的電源插座接收到115 VAC至120 VAC（交流電壓）的電壓。可以使用簡單的三叉測試儀，電壓表或萬用表進行驗證。程序上，切勿將電線從電線中拉出，因為這會導致電纜損壞和磨損。相反，您應該插入插頭並通過電源線末端的插頭拔出電纜。切勿使用磨損或損壞的電源線，這一點很重要 \n In addition to keeping themselves safe, technicians need to keep computers safe from electrical damage. It is common to use a surge protector to protect computers from power spikes or surges. A power strip is not the same thing as a surge protector. Surge protectors are rated in joules (J), a unit of energy. The rating indicates the number of joules the surge protector can absorb before failure. A higher rating indicates greater protection for the computer. Also, you must not overload the surge protectors, and must never daisy-chain them, or plug one surge protector into another: this causes higher amperage draws that can lead to fires. \n 除了保護自己的安全外，技術人員還需要保護電腦免受電氣損壞。 通常使用電湧保護器來保護電腦免受電源尖峰或電湧的影響。 配電盤與電湧保護器不是一回事。 電湧保護器的額定功率單位為焦耳（J）。 額定值表示電湧保護器在故障之前可以吸收的焦耳數。 額定值越高，表示對電腦的保護越高。 另外，您一定不能使電湧保護器過載，也不能以菊花鏈的方式將其電湧，或將一個電湧保護器插入另一個電湧保護器：這會導致電流消耗增加，從而引發火災。 \n If continuous power to a workstation is necessary, you can use an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). A UPS should never be used for laser printers, as it draws too much power through the UPS and can cause damage to the printer. \n 如果需要為工作站持續供電，則可以使用不間斷電源（UPS）。 切勿將UPS用於激光打印機，因為它會通過UPS消耗過多功率，並可能損壞印刷機。 \n \n When working with a computer, the largest amount of voltage you will find is located inside the computer’s power supply unit (PSU). You should never disassemble a PSU; when it is broken, simply replace the entire unit. Power supply units are relatively inexpensive, so it is a best practice to simply replace them. Some technicians wonder why they should not disassemble or open the PSU and try to fix it, but the reason is simple — it is very dangerous. A PSU has numerous electrical components that allow it to convert the high-voltage 115-120 VAC (or 230-240 VAC) power into the 12 VDC (volts direct current) that is usable by the computer. Some of these components are capacitors, which cause the power supply to retain lots of voltage (up to 10,000 volts or more) even after the computer is turned off and even after the computer and PSU are unplugged. Therefore, if you want to see the inside of a PSU, search for it on the Internet and look at a picture. It is much safer. \n 使用電腦時，您會發現最大的電壓位於計算機的電源設備（PSU）內部。 您切勿拆卸電源設備； 損壞時，只需更換整個單元。 電源設備相對便宜，因此最佳實踐是簡單地更換它們。 一些技術人員想知道為什麼不應該拆卸或打開PSU並嘗試對其進行修復，但是原因很簡單-這非常危險。 PSU具有許多電氣組件，可將115-120 VAC（或230-240 VAC）高壓電源轉換為計算機可使用的12 VDC（直流電壓）。 這些組件中的一些是電容器，即使在關閉電腦後以及拔下電腦和PSU的電源後，電源也會保持大量電壓（最高10,000伏或更高）。 因此，如果要查看PSU的內部，請在Internet上搜索並查看圖片。 這更安全。 \n \n \n p.21 \n Power Supplies \n 電源 \n Technicians should use surge protectors or surge suppressors to protect computers from power spikes and surges. These devices are specifically designed to absorb overvoltage conditions that would damage computers, printers, and monitors. While these devices will protect the computer from damage resulting from an overvoltage condition, they do not protect it from an undervoltage condition. Undervoltage is a condition that occurs when insufficient voltage is provided by the outlet to the computer. In situations where it is essential that the computer not lose power, technicians must install an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to provide emergency power when a power failure (blackout) occurs or an undervoltage condition (brownout) occurs. The UPS runs the computer from its internal battery continuously and recharges the UPS’s battery while power is available. Once power is lost, the UPS continues to power the computer for up to 15 minutes (purportedly). This provides the user enough time to save work and safely power down the workstation. Another device that helps in undervoltage conditions is the standby power supply (SPS), which runs the computer directly from the wall outlet (AC power), but switches to the battery in less than a millisecond when a power outage occurs. An SPS device does not provide constant power, like a UPS device. For this reason, most technicians prefer UPS devices over SPS devices, so UPS devices are much more common in the marketplace. \n 技術人員應使用電湧保護器或電湧抑制器來保護計算機免受電湧和電湧的影響。這些設備經過專門設計，可以吸收可能損壞 電腦 ，打印機和顯示器的過電壓情況。儘管這些設備可以保護 電腦 免受過壓狀態造成的損壞，但它們不能保護計算機免受欠壓狀態的影響。當計算機的插座提供的電壓不足時，就會發生欠壓情況。在必須確保 電腦 不掉電的情況下，技術人員必須安裝不間斷電源（UPS），以在發生電源故障（停電）或發生欠壓情況（斷電）時提供應急電源。 UPS會使用其內部電池連續運行 電腦 ，並在有電時為UPS的電池充電。一旦斷電，UPS將繼續為 電腦 供電長達15分鐘（據稱）。這為用戶提供了足夠的時間來節省工作並安全地關閉工作站電源。備用電源（SPS）是在欠壓情況下提供幫助的另一種設備，該備用電源直接從壁裝電源插座（交流電源）運行 電腦 ，但在斷電時不到一毫秒即可切換到電池。 SPS設備不像UPS設備那樣提供恆定功率。因此，大多數技術人員更喜歡UPS設備而不是SPS設備，因此UPS設備在市場上更為普遍。 \n \n Uninterruptible power supplies are rated in various ways, including their runtimes, network support capabilities, automatic shutdown capabilities, and surge suppression. The runtime dictates the amount of time a computer will keep running on power from the UPS’s battery once source power is removed. Usually, you want to use a UPS with at least 15 minutes of runtime support. The bigger the battery, the longer the runtime. The runtime is calculated based on volt-amps, which is discussed in more detail in a later section. UPS devices can also have software that allows them to be connected to the network. Therefore, when the UPS notices a drop in power, it can send out a message to the users that the network is being shut down because of power loss. Some UPS devices support automatic shutdown of the connected computer or server, so that once a switch to battery power occurs, the UPS sends a shutdown signal to the connected machine. Finally, most UPS devices also provide surge suppression capabilities, rated in joules. \n The last type of device technicians can use is called a power conditioner or line conditioner. These devices do not have any battery backup capability, but can rectify the power from a dirty power condition (where power fluctuates greatly) to a steady 115-120 VAC power condition. These devices can raise undervoltage conditions to normal levels, as well as cut overvoltage conditions back down to standard levels. This is very important if your systems are going to run from a backup generator, or if you are operating in an area with unstable power (such as in some developing countries). \n 不間斷電源的額定方式有多種，包括其運行時間，網絡支持功能，自動關機功能和電湧抑制。運行時間規定了斷開電源後 電腦 將繼續使用UPS電池供電的時間。通常，您要使用具有至少15分鐘運行時間支持的UPS。電池越大，運行時間越長。運行時間是基於伏安計算的，這將在後面的部分中詳細討論。 UPS設備還可以具有允許其連接到網絡的軟件。因此，當UPS注意到電源中斷時，它可以向用戶發送一條消息，通知您由於斷電而導致網絡正在關閉。某些UPS設備支持所連接的 電腦 或服務器的自動關機，因此一旦切換到電池電源，UPS就會向所連接的 電腦 發送關機信號。最後，大多數UPS設備還提供以焦耳為單位的電湧抑制功能。 \n 技術人員可以使用的最後一種設備稱為功率調節器或線路調節器。這些設備沒有任何備用電池功能，但是可以將電源從骯髒的電源狀況（電源波動很大）整流為穩定的115-120 VAC電源狀況。這些器件可將欠壓條件提高到正常水平，並將過壓條件降低迴標準水平。如果您的系統要使用備用發電機運行，或者您在電力不穩定的區域（例如在某些發展中國家）運行，則這非常重要。 \n \n p.22 \n Power Variation \n 功率變化 \n It is important to understand the technical terms for the various undervoltage and overvoltage conditions that could exist, such as power surge, dirty power, sag, brownout, and blackout, as well as the device that provides protection to the computers and computer system equipment when these conditions occur. A power surge occurs when a short increase in AC voltage happens, such as from 120 VAC to 130 VAC. To protect computers from this condition, you would use a surge suppressor. Dirty power occurs when AC voltage continuously fluctuates, for example between 113 VAC and 130 VAC. To correct this condition, an in-line UPS or line conditioner should be used. A sag occurs when an unexpected short decrease in voltage occurs. This can be corrected with either a line conditioner or a UPS. A brownout is a more significant, larger voltage drop than a sag, and could result in the voltage being cut in half (such as 120 VAC dropping to 60 VAC). This is too much for a line conditioner to handle, so a UPS would be required. Finally, if there is a complete loss of power, this is called a blackout. Only a UPS can solve this problem, but only for a short duration (purportedly about 15 minutes). If operations must continue after this, you would need to switch to a backup generator to provide the power required. \n 重要的是要理解可能存在的各種欠壓和過壓條件的技術術語，例如電湧，脹電源，跌落，掉電和停電，以及在以下情況下為 電腦 和 電腦 系統設備提供保護的設備：這些情況發生。當交流電壓發生短暫升高（例如從120 VAC到130 VAC）時，就會發生電湧。為了保護 電腦 免受這種情況的影響，應使用電湧抑制器。當交流電壓持續波動（例如在113 VAC和130 VAC之間）時，會產生臟電。要糾正這種情況，應使用串聯式UPS或線路調節器。當電壓出現意外的短時下降時，就會發生下垂。可以使用電源調節器或UPS進行糾正。掉電比下垂更為顯著，更大的電壓降，並且可能導致電壓降低一半（例如120 VAC降至60 VAC）。對於線路調節器來說，這太多了，因此需要UPS。最後，如果完全斷電，則稱為停電。只有UPS可以解決此問題，但只能持續很短的時間（據說大約15分鐘）。如果此後必須繼續操作，則需要切換到備用發電機以提供所需的電源。 \n \n p.23 \n Protecting People and Property \n 保護人身和財產 \n Electricity can be a common cause of fire, especially if the electrical circuits are overloaded. If a computer or outlet catches on fire, you should use a class C extinguisher, which is a carbon dioxide (CO2)-based extinguisher. You should not attempt to extinguish an electrical fire with water, because water conducts electricity. If the fire is small, you may use a portable extinguisher to put the fire out immediately, but you should never put yourself in harm’s way. If the fire begins to get out of control, everyone should move to a safe area and call 911 for help immediately. Some server rooms have built-in fire suppression systems that release CO2 or halon when a fire alarm occurs. Halon is a toxic compressed gas, in liquid form, that chemically disrupts a combustion reaction. A CO2 system is designed to flood the room with carbon dioxide in order to remove all oxygen from the room, thereby killing the fire. People who are working in a server room and hear the fire alarm sounding must immediately vacate the area and get to a safe location. This is a life-threatening situation, both because of the fire and because of the potentially lethal nature of the fire-suppression systems. \n 電力可能是引起火災的常見原因，尤其是在電路過載的情況下。如果 電腦 或插座著火，則應使用C類滅火器，它是一種基於二氧化碳（CO2）的滅火器。您不應嘗試用水滅火，因為水可以導電。如果火很小，則可以使用便攜式滅火器將火立即撲滅，但絕對不要傷害自己。如果火勢開始失控，所有人應移至安全區域並立即撥打911尋求幫助。一些服務器機房具有內置的滅火系統，當發生火災警報時，這些系統會釋放CO2或哈龍。哈龍是有毒的壓縮氣體，呈液態，化學上會破壞燃燒反應。 CO2系統設計用於向房間充斥二氧化碳，以清除房間中的所有氧氣，從而撲滅大火。在服務器機房工作並聽到火警警報的人員必須立即離開該區域並到達安全位置。由於起火以及滅火系統的潛在致命特性，這是威脅生命的情況。 \n \n p.24 \n Operational Procedures: Electrostatic Discharge \n 操作步驟：靜電放電 \n Another major safety hazard for computer systems and components is electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD damage is caused by the discharge of static electricity that has been built up by the human body in the course of everyday events, such as walking, standing and sitting at our desks, and other activities. In drier (less humid) environments, static electricity builds up more quickly and becomes more of an issue. This is especially true during winter months. While static electricity cannot directly harm humans very much, it can be deadly to computer components. A person builds static electricity that can reach 20,000 to 25,000 volts, but is of a low amperage (making it safe for humans). When you touch something of lower electrical potential, such as the metal case of the computer or the circuit board of an expansion card, the static electricity in your body is discharged into that component, causing damage. If you touch a circuit board without taking ESD precautions, ESD may occur and cause permanent failure or an intermittent failure of the component. \n You can protect computer equipment from ESD fairly easily. First, you should use an antistatic wrist strap, also known as an ESD strap. \n 電腦 系統和組件的另一個主要安全隱患是靜電放電（ESD）。 ESD損壞是由人體在日常活動（例如走路，站立和坐在辦公桌旁以及其他活動）過程中積聚的靜電釋放引起的。在乾燥（濕度較低）的環境中，靜電積聚更快，成為一個更大的問題。在冬季尤其如此。儘管靜電不會直接對人類造成太大傷害，但對 電腦 組件而言可能是致命的。一個人積聚的靜電可以達到20,000到25,000伏，但電流強度很低（對人類安全）。當您觸摸電勢較低的物體（例如計算機的金屬外殼或擴展卡的電路板）時，體內的靜電會釋放到該組件中，從而造成損壞。如果在未採取ESD預防措施的情況下觸摸電路板，則可能會發生ESD，並導致組件永久性故障或間歇性故障。 \n 您可以相當容易地保護 電腦 設備免受ESD的影響。首先，應使用防靜電腕帶，也稱為ESD腕帶。 \n \n These devices are very inexpensive and are the best method of protecting equipment against ESD. To be effective, one end of the strap must be grounded (by clipping it to something such as to the bare metal of the computer case), and the other end is placed around your wrist like a bracelet. This continually causes a discharge from the body to the computer case, thereby protecting the internal computer components. Because of the high voltage present inside a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, you should not wear an ESD wrist strap when working inside a CRT monitor. \n If you do not have an ESD strap, you can employ the second precautionary method, called grounding against the chassis. In this method, you touch any unpainted metal part of the computer case to discharge the static electricity from your body before touching the sensitive components (such as expansion cards). This method is quite good, but you must remember to ground yourself against the case every time before touching a component. The last precautionary method is to use anti-static bags. This procedure is useful during transport of various components. Basically, you place the components and cards inside the anti-static bag to protect them from ESD while you are carrying them from one location to another. \n 這些設備非常便宜，是保護設備免受ESD影響的最佳方法。為使之有效，必須將腕帶的一端接地（通過將其修剪到諸如 電腦 殼裸露的東西上），另一端像手鐲一樣放在手腕上。這連續地導致從身體向 電腦 機殼的放電，從而保護了內部 電腦 組件。由於陰極射線管（CRT）顯示器內部存在高壓，因此在CRT顯示器內部工作時，請勿佩戴ESD腕帶。 \n 如果沒有ESD綁帶，則可以採用第二種預防方法，即與機箱接地。通過這種方法，在觸摸敏感組件（例如擴展卡）之前，請觸摸 電腦 機箱上任何未上漆的金屬部分，以從身上釋放靜電。這種方法相當不錯，但是每次觸摸組件之前，您都必須記住要使自己始終與外殼接觸。最後一種預防方法是使用防靜電袋。此過程在運輸各種組件時很有用。基本上，將組件和卡從一個位置搬運到另一位置時，請將其放置在防靜電袋中，以防靜電。 \n \n To prevent ESD we must ensure we handle components properly. Never touch the face of the cards where the components and wiring are located; only handle cards by the edges. Additionally, always use proper ESD straps or grounding techniques before handling the cards. You also should remove jewelry and avoid loose clothes, since they may get caught in the computer or inadvertently cause a static charge to be transferred into a component. Another great technique is the use of an anti-static mat or workbench. Many server rooms and IT shops have these mats installed, and they provide a good method of keeping yourself grounded while working. You can also raise the humidity of the room to minimize the chances of static build-up. Most computer server rooms keep humidity between 40 and 50 percent to minimize electrostatic build-up, but often you will not have control over the humidity as a technician. You also want to avoid carpeted areas when possible, as walking across carpet creates a faster buildup of static electricity in the body. Finally, never use electrical or magnetic tools on the workstation, as the electrical motors from drills, impact wrenches, and vacuums create static electricity that can be discharged into fragile components. \n 為了防止ESD，我們必須確保正確處理組件。切勿觸摸組件和配線所在的卡的表面；只能處理邊緣的卡。此外，在處理插卡之前，請始終使用正確的ESD腕帶或接地技術。您還應卸下珠寶首飾並避免穿寬鬆的衣服，因為它們可能會卡在 電腦 中或無意間將靜電轉移到組件中。另一個很棒的技術是使用防靜電墊或工作台。許多服務器機房和IT商店都安裝了這些墊子，它們是在工作時保持接地的一種好方法。您還可以提高房間的濕度，以最大程度減少靜電積聚的機會。大多數 電腦 服務器機房將濕度保持在40％到50％之間，以最大程度地減少靜電積聚，但是作為技術人員，您通常無法控制濕度。您還希望盡可能避免舖有地毯的區域，因為在地毯上行走會在體內更快地積聚靜電。最後，切勿在工作站上使用電動或磁性工具，因為鑽頭，衝擊扳手和真空吸塵器產生的電動機會產生靜電，這些靜電會排放到易碎的部件中。 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '40728238 UNIT 2\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 13~24.html'}, {'title': '40923206 UNIT 2\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 25~36', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923206 UNIT 2\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 25~36.html'}, {'title': 'PCH2-Procedures and Safety', 'text': 'PCH 2/ 程序與安全 \n p25 \n Operational Procedures: Environmental Controls \n 操作程序：環境控制 \n *Describe effective ways to reduce the risk of injury or damage while working with computer systems. \xa0 \xa0 描述使用計算機系統時,受傷或損壞風險的有效方法。 \n \n \xa0 So, what is the best range of environmental controls to protect our workstations and provide our computers with the best operating environment? For temperature, we seek a range of 68-76 degrees Fahrenheit, and we attempt to keep the humidity between 20 and 60 percent. If the humidity is higher, it prevents electrostatic buildup. If the humidity is too high, though, condensation and water vapor can occur. It is a fragile balance, but the best rule of thumb is that if humans are comfortable, the environment is probably within the specifications. Also, we need to ensure proper ventilation for both people and computers. We want to minimize the dust in the environment and ensure adequate cooling to remove the heat created by the workstations. \xa0 \xa0那麼，什麼是保護我們工作站並為我們的計算機提供最佳操作環境的最佳控制範圍？溫度，我們尋求的溫度範圍為華氏68-76度，並且嘗試將濕度保持在20％到60％之間。如果濕度較高，則可防止靜電積聚。但是，如果濕度太高，則會發生冷凝和水蒸氣。這是一個脆弱的平衡，最好的經驗法則是，如果人類感到舒適，則環境可能在規格範圍內。此外，我們需要確保人和計算機的通風良好。我們希望能最大程度地減少環境中的灰塵，並確保充分冷卻以消除工作站產生的熱量。 \n \xa0 Additionally, we need to consider the chemicals that we often encounter in our daily jobs. Each product that uses chemicals must have a material safety data sheet (MSDS) with it. This sheet includes the proper treatment if a person comes into contact with the substance, how to deal with chemical spills, how to properly dispose of the chemicals, and proper storage of the substance. MSDS are required for all products with chemicals, including things like window cleaning solution as well as more complex compounds like the thermal paste that we use in workstations. \xa0 此外，我們需要考慮日常工作中經常遇到的化學物質。每個使用化學藥品的產品都必須隨附材料安全數據表（MSDS）。該表包括如果有人接觸該物質應進行的適當處理，如何處理化學溢出物，如何正確處理該化學物質以及正確地存儲該物質。所有含化學物質的產品都需要MSDS，包括窗戶清潔液以及更複雜的化合物（例如我們在工作站中使用的導熱膏）。 \n \n p26 \n Operational Procedures: Physical Safety \n 操作步驟：人身安全 \n *Explain appropriate safety measures and procedures while demonstrating basic computer assembly. \xa0 \xa0 在演示計算機的基本組裝時，請說明適當的安全措施和程序。 \n \xa0 Since we have considered the electrical dangers a technician might face, we must also consider the physical dangers. As information technology technicians, we often are involved in the “rollout” and replacement of existing systems, and in moving equipment from one office area to another. In this portion of our jobs, we often have to move hundreds of computers. Remember, the number one cause of injury for computer technicians is lifting items that are too heavy for us. A couple of rules of thumb to prevent injury: Do not lift anything over 25 percent of your own weight without assistance. Second, remember to always lift with your legs, not your back. If you follow these two simple rules, you can avoid the most common injuries in the workplace. \xa0 \xa0 由於我們已經考慮了技術人員可能面臨的電氣危險，因此我們還必須考慮物理危險。作為信息技術人員，我們經常參與“部署”和替換現有系統，以及將設備從一個辦公區域轉移到另一個辦公區域。在這部分工作中，我們經常不得不移動數百台計算機。請記住，計算機技術人員受傷的首要原因是提起對我們來說太重的物品。防止受傷的一些經驗法則：不要在沒有幫助的情況下舉起超過自身體重25％的東西。其次，請記住始終抬起雙腿，而不是背部。如果遵循這兩個簡單規則，則可以避免在工作場所中最常見的傷害。 \n \xa0 Another area of concern is our impatience. Often when we go to work on a computer, we first turn off the machine and then open it up. Many of us forget that the computer may have been on and running for the past several days or weeks, building up an enormous amount of heat that can cause burns. It is a good idea to wait at least 15 minutes before touching items at the workstation, such as a laser printer’s fuser, the central processing unit (CPU) of the computer, or the power supply of the computer. These areas tend to generate the most heat and need time to dissipate the heat prior to maintenance. \xa0 \xa0 另一個值得關注的領域是我們的耐心。通常，當我們在計算機上工作時，我們首先關閉機器，然後再將其打開。我們中的許多人都忘記了計算機可能已經在過去的幾天或幾週內開機並運行，從而積聚了大量的熱量，可能引起灼傷。最好等待至少15分鐘，然後再觸摸工作站上的物品，例如激光打印機的定影器，計算機的中央處理器（CPU）或計算機的電源。這些區域會產生最多的熱量，並且在維護之前需要時間消散熱量。 \n \xa0 Finally, we must be wary of how we route cables, and must practice proper cable management. Do not run cables in the walkways or through places where employees may trip over them. If a worker trips on the cord, not only will the worker get hurt, but the workstation itself could be pulled off the desk and damaged. Place the computer and cables in a place where adequate air flow can occur; otherwise, the computer may overheat and have issues functioning. Finally, always remember to check local regulations when installing new network cables. Some areas require certain licenses or certifications, such as an electrician’s license, to run network cables. Also, you will need to install plenum-rated cables if you are running them in areas such as the ceiling, where ventilation systems are found. \xa0 \xa0 最後，我們必須警惕如何佈設電纜，且必須進行適當的電纜管理。勿在走道或員工可能絆倒的地方設置電纜。如果工人用電線絆倒，不僅會受傷，而且工作站本身可能會從桌子上拉下來並損壞。請將計算機和電纜放置在可產生足夠空氣流通的地方；否則，計算機可能會過熱並出現問題。最後，在安裝新的網絡電纜時，切記要檢查當地法規。有些地區需要某些許可證或證明（例如電工許可證）才能運行網絡電纜。另外，如果要在通風良好的區域（例如天花板）上鋪設增壓電纜，則需要安裝增壓電纜。 \n \n \xa0 Proper cable management.

Well, imagine your boss just told you that her workstation lost its connection to the network. You run down to the server room to see if you can troubleshoot her connection. You look first to check if her cable is plugged in, but you find the mess of cables below. How do you determine which is your boss’ connection? This mess causes issues with ventilation, cooling, and more importantly issues when trying to troubleshoot. Always run the cabling with proper cable management techniques and label the cables to assist you in the future during troubleshooting. \xa0 那麼，為什麼電纜管理如此重要？好吧，想像一下您的老闆剛剛告訴您她的工作站失去了與網絡的連接。您跑到服務器機房查看是否可以對她的連接進行故障排除。您首先要檢查她的電纜是否已插入，但在下面發現電纜亂七八糟。您如何確定老闆的聯接方式？這種混亂會導致通風，冷卻問題，更重要的是，嘗試進行故障排除時會出現問題。始終使用適當的電纜管理技術來佈線，並標記電纜，以在將來進行故障排除時為您提供幫助。 \n \n \xa0 Unsafe cables.

These older monitors look like old televisions. These monitors tend to be very heavy, with 30” or larger models weighing nearly a hundred pounds. It is important to remember your lifting rules before moving these monitors. Most people are upgrading these old monitors to LCD or LED models, since they offer better picture quality and are much lighter. Many locations have special disposal rules for these devices. Many localities have a requirement to recycle monitors at a central waste facility. Finally, these monitors use capacitors to perform their functions. You must be careful not to open these monitors, as they can have 10,000-20,000 volts of potential voltage, even when they have been unplugged for long periods of time. \xa0 \xa0 您可能在現場發現的許多較舊的顯示器都是CRT顯示器。這些較舊的監視器看起來像舊電視。這些監視器往往非常重，具有30英寸或更大的型號，重量將近一百磅。在移動這些顯示器之前，請記住您的舉升規則，這一點很重要。大多數人都將這些舊顯示器升級為LCD或LED型號，因為它們提供了更好的圖像質量並且更輕。許多位置都有針對這些設備的處置規則。許多地方都要求在中央廢物處理設施回收監測器。最後，這些監視器使用電容器來執行其功能。您必須小心不要打開這些顯示器，因為即使長時間拔下插頭,它們也可能具有10,000-20,000伏的潛在電壓。 \n 影片網址: https://youtu.be/p2Oq_QmrrxU \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH2-Procedures and Safety.html'}, {'title': 'PCH3-Customer Relations', 'text': 'PCH 3/客戶關係 \n p28 \n * Recognize and explain the general principles of professional customer service. \xa0 \xa0 認識並解釋專業客戶服務的一般原則。 \n * Set up a computer system and demonstrate operation for the customer. \xa0 \xa0 設置計算機系統並為客戶演示操作。 \n p29 \n Overview \n 總覽 \n \xa0 In this lesson we will be discussing the standards of professional business conversations and the basics of customer service.

The IT field is unique in its own way, but it’s driven by customer service. While the standards of professional business conversations generally apply, there is also the unique aspect of the technician possessing “special knowledge” that a more senior professional may not possess. For example, a person whose computer you are there to fix may be a senior manager at your company, but they may have no idea about how to fix computers. You must, then, remain calm and measured in responding to the client’s needs, yet remain authoritative in your body of knowledge and procedures. This can be difficult for new technicians. Remember, always be kind and patient: the client needs your help! \xa0 \xa0我們需要意識到的第一件事是，在信息技術（IT）領域中的工作正在在客戶服務領域中。 IT領域以其自己的方式是獨特的，但它是由客戶服務驅動的。雖然通常使用專業商務對話的標準，但是技術人員具有 “高級專業知識”所不具備的 獨特之處，而高級專業人士可能不具備。例如，您要修理計算機的人可能是您公司的高級經理，但他們可能不知道如何修理計算機。然後，您必須保持冷靜並在回應客戶需求時保持冷靜，並在您的知識和程序中保持權威。對於新技術人員而言，這可能很困難。記住，永遠要仁慈和耐心：客戶需要您的幫助！ \n \n \xa0 Photo used under CC-BY-SA license from\xa0 Manchester City Library . \xa0 \xa0照片由曼徹斯特市圖書館根據CC-BY-SA許可使用。 \n Customer Service Key Principles\xa0 客戶服務關鍵原則 \n \xa0 Employers have indicated that there are several key principles to follow when handling customers to ensure that you are providing a positive customer service experience. \xa0 雇主表示，在處理客戶時要遵循幾個關鍵原則，以確保您提供積極的客戶服務體驗。 \n \xa0 Truly exceptional customer service involves surprising and delighting the customer by exceeding his or her expectations. Good customer service includes the following key elements: \xa0 \xa0 真正出色的客戶服務涉及超出客戶期望的驚喜和喜悅。良好的客戶服務包括以下關鍵要素： \n \n Effective listening.\xa0 \xa0 有效聆聽 。 \n Taking ownership of the situation.\xa0 \xa0 掌握情況 。 \n Apologizing when appropriate.\xa0 \xa0 適當的時候道歉 。 \n Remaining courteous and professional in all situations.\xa0 \xa0 在任何情況下都保持禮貌和專業 。 \n Handling situations in a timely manner.\xa0 \xa0 及時處理情況 。 \n Ensuring customers’ issues are resolved.\xa0 \xa0 確保解決客戶的問題 。 \n Checking back with customers to ensure the problem was resolved to their satisfaction.\xa0 \xa0 與客戶核對，以確保問題得到滿意的解決 。 \n \n \xa0 As a technician, depending on where you work, you will find that sometimes your customers are your company’s clients, and sometimes your customers are other employees at the company you work for. Whether they work for the same company that you do, are clients for your company, or are private individuals relying on your company, the same principles of customer service apply. \xa0 \xa0 作為技術人員，根據您的工作地點，您會發現有時您的客戶是您公司的客戶，有時您的客戶是您所在公司的其他員工。無論他們與您在同一家公司工作，是您公司的客戶，還是依靠您公司的私人人士，都適用相同的客戶服務原則。 \n p31 \n Effective Listening \n 有效聆聽 \n * Recognize and explain the general principles of professional customer service. \n 認識並解釋專業客戶服務的一般原則。 \n \xa0 This principle is one of the most important elements in the ability of an employee to deliver outstanding customer service. Effective listening involves paying careful attention to what the customer is saying and watching the customer’s body language (if the encounter is in person) to detect the nonverbal cues that give clues as to what the customer is thinking and feeling. \xa0 \xa0 該原則是員工提供出色客戶服務能力中最重要的要素之一。 有效的聆聽包括認真注意客戶在說什麼，並觀察客戶的肢體語言（如果是親自遇到的話），以發現非語言線索，從而提供有關客戶在想什麼和感覺的線索。 \n \n \xa0 Listening. Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from\xa0 Cabinet Office . \xa0 \xa0 聽著在CabinetOffice的CC-BY-NC-ND許可下使用的照片。 \n \xa0 An effective listener is able to ask clarifying questions to help define the situation. At the end of the exchange, the employee should be able to clearly restate what the real problem is and what the customer is asking the company to do in response. The example below illustrates effective listening skills. \xa0 \xa0 有效的傾聽者能夠提出明確的問題，以幫助確定情況。 在交換結束時，員工應該能夠清楚地說明真正的問題是什麼，以及客戶要求公司做些什麼作為回應。 下面的示例說明了有效的聆聽技巧。 \n EXAMPLE 例子 \n 參考影片:\xa0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4DQvwKTj0k \n Representative: Hello, thank you for calling the Metro Power Company, how may I help you? \n Customer: Hi, I need to report that my power is currently out. \n Representative: I’m happy to record the outage. I’ll need to get just a bit more information from you to properly document the outage. What is the service address, please? \n Customer: 456 Park Street, Cityville, Delaware. \n Representative: Thank you. And your name, please? \n Customer: Emily Fisher. \n Representative: Thank you Ms. Fisher. You are indicating that your power is out now. Let me check to see if we are already aware of the outage in your area. (pause) Thank you for your patience while I pull the information up in our system. \n Customer: Sure. \n Representative: OK, thanks again for your patience. An outage in your area has been documented, and there are currently technicians working to correct the issue. \n Customer: Do you know when service will be restored? \n Representative: The current estimate is that power should be restored in two to four hours. \n Customer: Well, that’s not too bad. Thanks for the information. \n Representative: You’re quite welcome. Is there anything else that I can help you with today? \n Customer: No, that’s all. \n Representative: Thank you for calling Metro Power Company. \n 代表：您好，謝謝您致電都會電力公司，我該如何幫助您？ \n 客戶：您好，我需要我停機的原因。 \n 代表：我很高興能為您服務。我需要從您那裡獲取更多信息，以正確記錄停機情況。請問服務地址是什麼？ \n 客戶：特拉華州Cityville公園街456號。 \n 代表：謝謝。請問您的名字？ \n 客戶：艾米麗·費舍爾（Emily Fisher）。 \n 代表：謝謝費雪女士。您指示您的電源已耗盡。讓我檢查一下是否已經知道您所在地區的停電情況。 （暫停）感謝您在我在系統中獲取信息時的耐心配合。 \n 客戶：好的。 \n 代表：好的，再次感謝您的耐心配合。已記錄您所在區域的中斷，並且目前有技術人員正在糾正此問題。 \n 客戶：您知道何時恢復服務嗎？ \n 代表：當前估計是應該在兩到四個小時內恢復供電。 \n 客戶：嗯，還算不錯。謝謝。 \n 代表：不用客氣。今天還有什麼我可以幫助您的嗎？ \n 客戶：不，僅此而已。 \n 代表：感謝您致電都會電力公司。 \n \xa0 In the conversation that we just reviewed, the customer service representative is polite, asks clarifying questions and confirms that she has the correct information, which indicates that she is using effective listening skills. She also thanks the customer for her patience with the outage and provides information on when the power is expected to be turned back on. The customer service representative also asks if the customer has any additional needs and thanks her for reporting the outage. All of this is conducted in a polite tone of voice. \xa0 \xa0 在我們剛剛審核的對話中，客戶服務代表很有禮貌，詢問您要澄清的問題並確認她掌握了正確的信息，這表明她正在使用有效的聆聽技巧。 她還感謝客戶對停電的耐心等待，並提供了有關何時應重新打開電源的信息。 客戶服務代表還詢問客戶是否還有其他需求，並感謝她報告中斷情況。 所有這些都是以禮貌的語調進行的。 \n \xa0 When effective listening is used properly, customers will feel that you are empathizing with them and will think that you understand their situation. Truly empathizing with a customer means that you are able to mentally place yourself in the customer’s situation and understand what the customer is actually feeling at that time. An employee who has the ability to recognize and acknowledge the customer’s concerns as though the employee were actually walking in the customer’s shoes is empathizing with the customer. Employees may establish a connection with customers by sharing their own similar experiences and letting the customers know, “I understand how hard this must be for you right now.” Empathy goes beyond sympathy. \xa0 \xa0 正確使用有效的聆聽後，客戶會覺得您理解他們，並了解他們的處境。 真正地同情客戶意味著您能夠在心理上置身於客戶的情況中，並了解當時客戶的實際感受。 能夠識別並確認客戶顧慮的員工，置身於客戶的角度看事情，對客戶產生同情。 員工可以通過分享自己的相似經歷並讓客戶知道“我知道現在這對您來說有多麼艱辛”，可以與客戶建立聯繫。 同理心超越同情。 \n \xa0 Here are several examples of empathetic statements that can create a connection with a customer in a positive way: \xa0 \xa0 以下是傭有同理心的幾個示例，這些示例可以以積極的方式與客戶建立聯繫： \n \n "I am sorry the power is out right now. It is such a hot day and I know that it must be frustrating for you. Our company is working hard to restore power in your area so that you can have air conditioning again soon." \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 “很抱歉，目前電源已經關閉。天氣真熱，我知道那一定會讓您感到沮喪。我們公司正在努力恢復您所在地區的電源，以便您可以很快再次使用空調。” \n "I know how frightening it must have been when the plane experienced bad turbulence on that last flight. I get somewhat anxious when I fly and I really hate it when the ride is bumpy." \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 “我知道當飛機在最後一次飛行中遇到嚴重的湍流時，一定會感到多麼恐懼。我飛行時會有些焦慮，而當飛機顛簸時我真的很討厭它。” \n “You must be very frustrated that your computer can’t connect to the Internet. I need Internet access for almost everything that I do, so I know how hard it is to try to work without it. We’re figuring out the source of your connectivity issue, and we’ll fix it as soon as possible.” \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 “您一定對計算機無法連接到互聯網感到非常沮喪。 我幾乎需要做的所有事情都需要Internet訪問，所以我知道沒有Internet嘗試工作會有多麼困難。 我們正在找出您的連接問題的根源，並將盡快解決。”\xa0 \n \n \xa0\xa0 As a technician, it’s important to remember that not all customers will have a detailed knowledge of computers. We should use proper language that is simple and concise, not technical jargon that is confusing. If you are dealing with computer novices, it doesn’t help them for you to tell them the reason for their Internet connectivity issue is that “layer 3 of the OSI model is not functioning properly.” Instead, use effective listening principles to hear the customer’s problem, then share that the router isn’t working properly and therefore the customer cannot access the Internet, but you are going to get it fixed for them quickly. You must listen to the customer and clarify the problem. Don’t interrupt the customer, and always ensure you are restating the issue to the customer to confirm your understanding of the problem. \xa0 \xa0 作為技術人員，重要的是要記住，並非所有客戶都會對計算機有詳盡的了解。 我們應該使用簡單明了的適當語言，而不要使用容易引起混淆的技術術語。 如果您正在與計算機新手打交道，這並不能幫助他們告訴他們互聯網連接問題的原因是“ OSI模型的第3層無法正常運行”。 取而代之的是，使用有效的偵聽原理來聽取客戶的問題，然後分享路由器無法正常工作，因此客戶無法訪問Internet，但是您將很快為他們解決問題。 您必須聽取客戶的意見並澄清問題。 不要打擾客戶，並始終確保您將問題重述給客戶，以確認您對問題的理解。 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n p32\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n Taking Ownership \n 取得所有權\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n * Recognize and explain the general principles of professional customer service. \xa0 \xa0 認識並解釋專業客戶服務的一般原則。 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 Customers expect that an employee will take ownership of a situation. Taking ownership means that the employee takes responsibility for the situation and reassures the customer that the employee will take action. The employee should follow through and follow up afterwards to make sure the situation was resolved to the customer’s satisfaction. The employee should also promise to keep the customer informed as to what is happening along the way. An employee who is truly taking ownership of a situation is in regular contact with the customer, is continually trying to resolve the problem, and strives to keep the customer in the information loop. \xa0 \xa0 客戶期望員工將擁有情況的所有權。 擁有所有權意味著員工對情況負責，並向客戶保證員工將採取行動。 員工應跟進並隨後跟進，以確保情況得到解決，以使客戶滿意。 員工還應承諾使客戶了解沿途情況。 真正掌握情況所有權的員工與客戶保持定期聯繫，正在不斷嘗試解決問題，並努力使客戶保持信息循環。 \n Apologizing When Appropriate\xa0 \xa0 適當道歉 \n \xa0 Another effective customer service principle is to apologize when it is appropriate. There are two types of apologies. One type is used when the employee is taking ownership of a problem and apologizing for something that his company did or did not do: \xa0 \xa0 另一個有效的客戶服務原則是在適當的時候道歉。 道歉有兩種類型。 當員工對某個問題承擔所有權並為公司所做或未做的事情道歉時，使用一種類型： \n \n "I am sorry that I did not call you back yesterday to follow up."\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 “很抱歉昨天我沒有給您回電話。” \n "I am sorry that our company did not ship the product that you ordered."\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 “我很抱歉，我們的公司並沒有發貨您所訂購的產品。” \n \n \xa0 It is always appropriate to apologize for errors that your company has made and to try to resolve them to the best of your ability. It is especially important to apologize to a customer who has become angry or frustrated about the situation. \xa0 \xa0 對於您的公司所犯的錯誤，並儘力解決這些錯誤，總是很抱歉的。 向因這種情況而感到生氣或沮喪的客戶道歉尤其重要。 \n \xa0 In some cases, the customer is angry about a situation that is really not the company’s fault, and that may not be something that the company can resolve at that point in time. In these situations, it may be appropriate to offer kind and sympathetic words that sound somewhat like an apology in order to defuse the situation. Examples of this might include: \xa0 \xa0 在某些情況下，客戶會對這種情況感到生氣，而這並非公司的過錯，而這可能不是公司當時可以解決的。 在這種情況下，為了緩和這種情況，可能應該提供聽起來像道歉的友善和同情的詞。 例如： \n \n "I am so sorry that you are frustrated."\xa0 “對不起，讓您感到沮喪。” \n "I am sorry that happened to you."\xa0 “對不起，這件事發生在你身上。” \n \n EXAMPLE\xa0 例子 \n \n Ron is a customer at a computer supply store. He calls one morning to talk with Joe, the manager. \n “Joe, I came by the store yesterday at 5:15 p.m. to get some things I needed to finish a job. It was really important that I finish the job yesterday. Your store was closed and I couldn’t get what I needed. I know you close at 5 p.m., but I thought for sure there would still be someone there. It was only 5:15. Some of your staff are usually there past 5 p.m. I didn’t get the job finished and lost a lot of money! I’m never shopping at your store again!” \n Let’s take a look at how Joe might respond. \n 羅恩（Ron）是一家計算機用品商店的客戶。 他打電話給一個早晨與經理喬談話。 \n “喬，我昨天下午5:15在商店走。 拿到一些我完成工作所需的東西。 我昨天完成工作真的很重要。 您的商店關門了，我找不到我想要的東西。 我知道你下午5點關門，但是我想肯定還會有人在那兒。 只要到5:15。 您的一些員工通常在下午5點以後到達。 我沒有完成工作，卻損失了很多錢！ 我再也不會在您的商店購物了！” \n 讓我們看一下喬可能如何回應。 \n Show Empathy\xa0 \xa0 顯示同理心 \n \xa0 \xa0 “I understand how frustrated you must be.” In this situation, the company didn’t do anything wrong, so it would not be appropriate for Joe to apologize for the fact that the store closed at the regular posted time. If he says, “I’m so sorry we closed at 5 p.m., we really should have stayed open later,” it undermines the fact that the store has regular operating hours that are posted clearly on the door and on the company’s website. \xa0 \xa0 “我知道你一定很沮喪。” \xa0 在這種情況下，公司沒有做錯任何事情，因此喬不宜因商店在正常發佈時間關閉而道歉。 \xa0 如果他說：“對不起，我們下午5點關門，我們確實應該晚點營業。”這破壞了商店的正常營業時間清楚地印在門上和公司網站上的事實。 \n \xa0 Joe needs to determine an appropriate response that acknowledges the customer’s frustration without undermining store policy. \xa0 \xa0 喬 需要確定一個適當的響應，在不損害商店政策的前提下，承認客戶的挫敗感。 \n \n "This will take a bit longer than I thought, would you like to continue to hold or may I call you back?"\xa0 “這將比我想像的要花費更長的時間，您想繼續保留還是可以給您回電？” \n "Is there a good number where I can reach you when I have the answer?"\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 “找到答案後，能找到您的電話嗎？” \n \n \xa0 Expectation management is crucial: always set expectations and meet those expectations. Do\xa0 not \xa0 promise something you cannot deliver. As you work through the problem, maintain a positive attitude and tone of voice; you will get more referrals and business if you remain likeable. Remember: the customer isn’t the problem, the customer is the one \xa0 with \xa0 the problem. So, don’t argue with the customer; just solve the problem. Also, don’t minimize the customer’s issues: to the customer, it is a horrible, tragic, big problem that they need you to fix. Never blame the customer for the problem or be judgmental toward the customer. Saying “If you didn’t go to that website, you wouldn’t have this problem” isn’t helpful, it is just insulting. Also, your mobile phone can wait while you are interacting with a customer. Give the customer your full attention and avoid distractions. \xa0 \xa0 期望管理至關重要：始終設定期望並滿足這些期望。 不要承諾無法交付的東西。 解決問題時，請保持積極的態度和語氣； 如果您仍然喜歡，您將獲得更多的推薦和生意。 請記住：客戶不是問題，客戶是有問題的人。 因此，請勿與客戶爭論； 只是解決問題。 另外，不要最小化客戶的問題：對客戶而言，這是一個可怕的，悲劇性的大問題，需要他們解決。 切勿將問題歸咎於客戶或對客戶作出判斷。 說“如果您不訪問該網站，就不會遇到這個問題”，這無濟於事，只是侮辱。 同樣，您的手機可以在與客戶互動時等待。 給客戶充分的關注，避免分心。 \n Timeliness \xa0 \n 及時性 \n \xa0 It is important to resolve customer issues as quickly as possible. The longer a problem persists without resolution, the greater the customer’s level of frustration. \xa0 \xa0 盡快解決客戶問題很重要。 無法解決的問題持續的時間越長，客戶的沮喪程度就越大。 \n How do you judge timeliness?\xa0 \xa0您如何判斷及時性？ \n \xa0\xa0 Timeliness is actually a very subjective thing: it is truly something that is defined by the customer and the situation. Some customers expect an immediate response (i.e. now or in the very near future: five to ten minutes). Other customers understand that the problem may take some time to resolve and may be willing to wait a couple of hours. Still others understand that the situation is going to take more time to resolve for a variety of reasons. For example, some more extensive repairs may be delayed for several days while waiting for parts to arrive. \xa0 \xa0 及時性實際上是一個非常主觀的東西：它確實是由客戶和情況所定義的東西。 一些客戶希望得到立即響應（即現在或不久的將來：五到十分鐘）。 其他客戶知道該問題可能需要一些時間才能解決，並且可能願意等待幾個小時。 還有一些人知道，由於多種原因，這種情況將需要更多時間來解決。 例如，在等待零件到達之前，一些更大規模的維修可能會延遲幾天。 \n \xa0 The nature of the problem will dictate what is a timely response. If a user or customer is at a work stoppage, a quick response by the technician is expected. If a user has forgotten a password, an immediate password reset is a timely response. In the case of a non-functioning printer in a room with other printers, a slower response is more acceptable. \xa0 \xa0 問題的性質將決定什麼是及時的響應。 如果用戶或客戶處於工作停頓狀態，則技術人員會做出快速響應。 如果用戶忘記了密碼，則立即重置密碼是及時的響應。 如果房間中的打印機無法正常運行，而其他打印機則可以接受較慢的響應。 \n \n \xa0 Photo used under CC-BY-NC license from \xa0 Tyle . 照片由Tyle根據CC-BY-NC許可使用。 \n Keeping the Customer Informed\xa0\xa0 保持客戶知情 \n \xa0\xa0 No matter how long a situation takes to resolve, it is critically important to continue to check back with customers and let them know that you are working on the problem during the process. This interaction helps lessen customers’ frustration, because they understand that you have not forgotten them and are working hard to resolve the situation. This strategy is tied closely to the issue of handling situations in a timely manner. A customer who is informed regularly throughout a situation, no matter how long it takes to resolve, is generally more happy with the outcome in the end. \xa0 \xa0 無論情況要花多長時間解決，至關重要的是繼續與客戶核對並讓他們知道您在此過程中正在解決問題。 這種互動有助於減輕客戶的沮喪感，因為他們知道您沒有忘記他們，並且正在努力解決問題。 該策略與及時處理情況緊密相關。 不管情況需要花費多長時間，在整個情況下定期得到通知的客戶通常會對最終結果感到更滿意。 \n p34 \n Problem Resolution and Follow-Up \xa0\xa0 \n 問題解決與跟進 \n * Recognize and explain the general principles of professional customer service. \xa0 \xa0 認識並解釋專業客戶服務的一般原則。 \n \xa0 It is imperative to follow up with the customer after problem resolution and make sure that everything was handled to the customer’s satisfaction, if at all possible. \xa0 \xa0 解決問題後必須與客戶保持聯繫，並確保一切可能的事情都得到客戶的滿意。 \n What are the limits on ensuring customer issues are resolved?\xa0 確保解決客戶問題有哪些限制？ \n \xa0 S ometimes it is impossible to resolve the situation to a customer’s complete satisfaction. A computer that was involved in a power spike might be a total loss and may not be able to be repaired. A computer virus may infect and destroy sensitive data on a key project. Sometimes valuable items are broken or damaged badly in a shipment. The customer may have special sentimental attachment to certain items. Or, data that was lost because of a system failure may not have been stored anywhere else. Lost or damaged items may not be replaceable, or a new item may not have the same sentimental meaning as the one that was lost or damaged. Lost data may be very difficult to reproduce. These types of situations are just part of life. \xa0 \xa0 有時無法解決這種情況以使客戶完全滿意。 涉及電源峰值的計算機可能會造成全部損失，並且可能無法修復。 計算機病毒可能感染並破壞關鍵項目上的敏感數據。 有時，裝運中的貴重物品嚴重損壞或損壞。 客戶可能對某些物品有特殊的情感依戀。 或者，由於系統故障而丟失的數據可能沒有存儲在其他任何地方。 丟失或損壞的物品可能無法更換，或者一件新物品可能與丟失或損壞的物品具有不同的情感含義。 丟失的數據可能很難重現。 這些情況只是生活的一部分。 \n \xa0 If the situation cannot be resolved to the customer’s satisfaction, it is important to apologize for that and to express sympathy and empathy for the way that the customer is feeling at that point in time. Some examples might be: \xa0 \xa0 如果無法解決這種情況以使客戶滿意，則必須為此道歉並表達對客戶當時感覺的同情和理解。 一些示例可能是： \n \n "I know how much you loved that car! I am so sorry it was totaled in that accident. I am just glad that you were not hurt." \xa0 \xa0 “我知道你對那輛車有多愛！我很抱歉那次事故我造成的損害。我很高興你沒有受傷。” \n "I am so sorry that your favorite vase was broken during the move. I understand that it was your mother’s, and is not something that you can replace. We feel really bad about that." \xa0 \xa0 “很抱歉，您最喜歡的花瓶在搬家過程中被弄壞了。我知道那是您母親給您的花瓶，不是可以更換的東西。對此我們感到非常遺憾。” \n "I know how disappointing it is that you’ve lost photos on your hard drive due to the lightning storm. I’m sorry that you’re going through this now. I know how much those photos must have meant to you; my photos of the trip I took with my family this summer mean more to me than I can say." \xa0 \xa0 “我知道您因雷雨而丟失了硬盤驅動器上的照片，這真令人傷心。對於您正在歷經此事，我們深感抱歉。我知道這些照片一定對您意味著什麼；我的照片今年夏天我與家人的旅行中，對我來說意義重大，莫過於我所能說的。” \n \n \xa0 Always follow up with customers after repairs to verify that they are satisfied. This is a good approach for two reasons. First, the customer may be experiencing problems and would appreciate your indication that you are available to help rectify the problem. Second, the customer may have more business or a referral for you, because they were so happy with your performance. This is good customer service and also good business sense! \xa0 \xa0 維修後請始終與客戶保持聯繫，以確保他們滿意。 這是一個好方法，有兩個原因。 首先，客戶可能遇到問題，希望您能幫助您解決問題。 其次，客戶可能會對您有更多的業務或推薦，因為他們對您的表現非常滿意。 這是良好的客戶服務，也具有良好的商業意識！ \n p35 \n Proper Treatment of a Customer’s Property \xa0\xa0 妥善處理客戶財產 \n * Set up a computer system and demonstrate operation for the customer. \xa0 \xa0 設置計算機系統並為客戶演示操作。 \n \xa0 Customers often entrust their confidential and personal data to you in order to have their devices repaired. Above all, respect the customers and their property. There are fundamental rules a technician should follow when handling a customer’s property: \xa0 \xa0 客戶通常將其機密和個人數據託付給您，以便對其設備進行維修。 \xa0 首先，要尊重客戶及其財產。 \xa0 技術人員在處理客戶財產時應遵循的基本規則： \n \n Do not use a customer’s equipment for personal use. You may have been tasked with setting up email on a customer’s smartphone. That doesn’t give you the right to make personal calls on their phone while it is in your possession. \xa0 \xa0 請勿將客戶的設備用於個人用途。 您可能被要求在客戶的智能手機上設置電子郵件。 這並不意味著您擁有在您擁有的電話上通過電話撥打私人電話的權利。 \n Do not look through a device’s storage unless you need to in order to perform the job requested. If a customer asks you to back up all of his documents, it may be necessary to open the documents folder on the hard disk to copy those files over. This would be acceptable, but if he asked for documents and you are browsing through his pictures folder, this is unacceptable and outside the scope of the required job. \xa0 \xa0 除非需要執行請求的工作，否則請勿瀏覽設備的存儲空間。 如果客戶要求您備份所有文檔，則可能有必要打開硬盤上的documents文件夾以復制這些文件。 這是可以接受的，但是如果他要文件，而您正在瀏覽他的圖片文件夾，則這是不可接受的，超出了所需工作的範圍。 \n Ensure reasonable testing of a device. If you were testing a printer, you should print the minimal amount to verify functionality. There is no need to print 100 pages to verify that a printer works when a single page will suffice. Furthermore, ensure that the content printed is not offensive or personal in nature. \xa0 \xa0 確保合理測試設備。 如果要測試打印機，則應打印最少的數量以驗證功能。 當單頁就足夠時，無需打印100頁即可驗證打印機是否工作。 此外，請確保所打印的內容不具有冒犯性或個人性質。 \n Return all settings to the customer’s preferences. When you work on someone’s machine or device, return the device with all settings reverted to the customer’s preferences. If the monitor resolution must be changed to accomplish the repair task, ensure the customer’s preferred resolution is restored when the job is complete. \xa0 \xa0 將所有設置恢復為客戶的偏好設置。 \xa0 當您在某人的機器或設備上工作時，請返回設備並將所有設置恢復為客戶的首選項。 \xa0 如果必須更改顯示器分辨率才能完成維修任務，請確保在作業完成後恢復客戶的首選分辨率。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \xa0 Above all, respect customers and their property. Remember that you are a customer too; think of how you would like to be treated, and ensure that you treat your customers in this manner. \xa0 \xa0 首先，要尊重客戶及其財產。 請記住，您也是客戶。 考慮如何對待您，並確保您以這種方式對待客戶。 \n \n Warm welcome and friendly smile.\xa0 \xa0 熱情的歡迎和友好的微笑。 \n Effective listening.\xa0\xa0 有效傾聽。 \n Empathy.\xa0 \xa0同情。 \n Follow-through and follow-up.\xa0\xa0 跟進再跟進。 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH3-Customer Relations.html'}, {'title': '40923216 UNIT 3\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 37~48', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923216 UNIT 3\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 37~48.html'}, {'title': '40923220 UNIT 3\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 49~60', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923220 UNIT 3\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 49~60.html'}, {'title': '40923227 UNIT 3\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 61~72', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923227 UNIT 3\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 61~72.html'}, {'title': '40923233 UNIT 3~4 Page 73~84', 'text': 'cool down(冷卻) \n \n When current flows in a computer circuit, it will generate heat when it encounters a resistance. The larger the current, the better the computer\'s computing performance to cope with the specific operations that require a lot of calculations, but more heat will come with it. Other heat-generating sources include optical drives, hard disks, power switches, etc. The power switches also generate a lot of heat when AC power is converted to DC power, so power supplies usually have their own dedicated cooling fan. \n 電流在計算機電路中流動時遇到電阻時就會產生熱能，越大的電流會讓計算機的運算效能變好以應付需要大量計算的特定操作但隨之而來的也會是更大的熱能。其他會產生熱能的有光盤驅動器、硬碟、電源交換器等等，其中電源交換器在交流電轉直流電也會產生大量熱能，所以電源供應器通常會有自己專屬的一顆散熱風扇。 \n Thermal effect(熱效應) \n If the heat inside the computer is too high, the BIOS may reduce the CPU frequency to prevent overheating from damaging the internal electronic components. The hard disk drive, CPU, and GPU are all sensitive to temperature changes. Due to the expansion and contraction of equipment components, and the hard disk drive will cause irreparable damage due to temperature changes. This may cause read/write errors, or even complete failure of the disk drive. \n \n 如果計算機內部的熱量過高，則BIOS可能會降低CPU頻率避免過熱損傷內部電子元件，硬盤驅動器、CPU和GPU都對溫度變化敏感。由於設備組件的膨脹和收縮，且硬盤驅動器會因溫度變化而造成不可挽回的損害。這可能導致讀/寫錯誤，甚至導致磁盤驅動器完全故障。 \n Reduce calories(減少熱量) \n Use heat sinks to draw heat away from sensitive components (such as CPU, GPU, North Bridge and South Bridge) through conduction. Use a fan to blow (suck) away the heat on the radiating fins, and then take the heat out of the case through the vents of the case. \n 使用散熱器通過傳導將熱量從敏感組件（例如CPU，GPU，北橋和南橋）吸走。用風扇將散熱鰭片上的熱量吹(吸)走，在經過機殼通風口將熱量帶出機殼。 \n BIOS settings(BIOS設置) \n Most motherboards and BIOS have a word on the temperature monitoring of the host and its components. For the ultra-flat motherboard, the current, voltage, frequency, etc. can be customized to increase or decrease its computing power. \n 大多數主板和BIOS都有之詞對主辦及其組件的溫度監控。對於之詞超平的主板可以自訂義電流、電壓、頻率等，以增加或減少其運算能力。 \n \n Cooling method(冷卻方法) \n The active air consists of a fan and a cooling plate made of aluminum or copper. The fan blows air onto the cooling fins above the components. The heat dissipation fins increase the surface of the metal plate and increase the heat dissipation capacity. However, components that generate heat from active air cannot be cooled below room temperature because active cooling uses air from the room. \n 主動空氣由風扇和鋁或銅製成的冷卻板組成。風扇將空氣吹到組件上方的散熱鰭片上。散熱鰭片增加了金屬板的表面，增加散熱能力。但主動空氣產生熱量的組件無法冷卻到室溫以下，因為主動冷卻使用來自房間的空氣。 \n Passive air cooling(被動風冷) \n The difference between passive air cooling is the size of the heat sink, the heat sink must be large enough, and it must also have enough space for natural air flow, and thus heat dissipation. In terms of power saving, passive air cooling is the most effective cooling method because it does not use any power source. The disadvantage of this method is that it is heavy, which increases the total weight and reduces the usable area inside the chassis. \n 被動空氣冷區別在於散熱器的大小，散熱片必須足夠大，並且還必須具有足夠的空間，以便自然的空氣流動，從而散熱。省電而言，被動式空氣冷卻是最有效的冷卻方式，因為它不用任何電源。這種方法的缺點是重量大，會增加總重量並減小機箱內部的可用面積。 \n Liquid cooling(液體冷卻) \n Liquid cooling uses the basic principles of thermodynamics. Heat transfers from hotter objects to colder objects, transferring more heat than air, making liquid cooling very suitable for overclocking and high-performance computer applications, and liquid cooling is not affected by ambient temperature Influence, compared with active cooling, liquid cooling uses a quieter and smaller fan, but the main disadvantages of liquid cooling are complexity and cost. Water vapor and liquid leakage may damage the electronic components inside the computer. \n 液體冷卻利用了熱力學的基本原理，熱量從較熱的物體轉移到較冷的物體，比空氣傳遞更多的熱量，使液體冷卻非常適合超頻和高性能計算機應用，且液體冷卻不受環境溫度的影響，與主動冷卻相比，液體冷卻使用的風扇更安靜、更小，但液體冷卻的主要缺點是複雜性和成本。可能結水氣、漏液造成計算機內部電子元件的損傷。 \n Cooling installation and maintenance(冷卻安裝和維護) \n 機箱風扇(Case fan) \n The chassis fan is mainly used to exhaust the hot air in the case and replace it with fresh cold air. Usually the colder air is close to the ground, so most of them are designed to suck in the system from the bottom. Then, the hot air is discharged from the rear of the case near the CPU and the side of the case near the graphics processing unit. \n 機箱風扇主要用於排出機殼內的熱空氣替換成新鮮的冷空氣，通常較冷的空氣靠近地面，因此大多數都設計成從底部吸入系統。然後，熱空氣從CPU附近的機箱後部以及圖形處理單元附近的機箱側面排出。 \n Liquid cooling: installation(液體冷卻：安裝) \n Turn off the computer and unplug the power plug-open the case-clean the CPU and water block-remove dust and debris-use thermal paste-install the heat sink-connect the heat sink to the water tank-make sure to reconnect the power supply-turn on the computer power-ensure the liquid The cooling system is operating normally-close the housing \n 關閉計算機電源並拔下電源插頭-打開機箱-清潔CPU和水塊-清除灰塵和碎屑-使用導熱膏-安裝散熱器-將散熱器連接到水箱-確保重新連接電源-打開計算機電源-確保液體冷卻系統正常運行-關閉外殼 \n Network overview(網路概述) \n Various network relationships including local area networks, wide area networks, personal local area networks, and metropolitan area networks, such as client/server and peer-to-peer networks, and discuss the types of network resources. \n 各種網絡關係包括局域網、廣域網、個人局域網和城域網各種網絡關係，例如客戶端/服務器和對等網絡，並討論網絡資源類型。 \n Geographically defined network(地理定義的網絡) \n The geographic location covered by the network. Starting from the area around a person, the area is called a personal area network (PAN). Next, expand out to the local area network (LAN), which contains the entire office floor or building. Moving outward again, we have a metropolitan area network, which is connected by multiple LANs to cover the entire city. Finally, there is a wide area network (WAN). The largest network defined by geographic location, it can spread all over the country or even the whole world. \n 網絡所覆蓋的地理位置。從一個人周圍的區域開始，將該區域稱為個人區域網絡（PAN）。接下來，向外擴展到局域網（LAN），該局域網包含整個辦公樓層或建築物。再次向外移動，我們有城域網，城域網通過多個LAN連接在一起而覆蓋了整個城市。最後，有了廣域網（WAN）。按地理位置定義的最大網絡，它可以遍及全國甚至遍及全球。 \n \n Personal area network(個人區域網) \n The range is very small, only a few meters, and Bluetooth is one of the main content used to create PAN, although USB and infrared can also be used for these networks. The range of Bluetooth is between 1 meter and 100 meters, depending on the type of Bluetooth used. \n 範圍很小，只有幾米，藍牙是用於創建PAN的主要內容之一，儘管USB和紅外也可以用於這些網絡。藍牙的範圍在1米至100米之間，取決於使用的藍牙類別。 \n Metropolitan Area Network(城域網) \n Think of it as MAN. Connect scattered locations throughout the city or county. This covers a larger geographic area than a local area network, but much smaller than a wide area network. \n 將其作為MAN。連接整個城市或縣的分散位置。這比局域網覆蓋更大的地理區域，但是比廣域網覆蓋的區域小得多。 \n Wan(廣域網) \n Connect remotely located network components together. This can be done through a virtual private network (VPN) on the Internet or using a dedicated leased line that actually connects the city pairs together. Once the two local area networks are connected, they become part of the larger WAN topology. \n 將地理位置遙遠的網絡組件連接在一起。可以通過Internet上的虛擬專用網絡（VPN）或使用將城市對實際連接在一起的專用租用線路來完成。兩個局域網一旦連接，它們便成為更大的廣域網拓撲的一部分。 \n Topology-defined network(拓撲定義的網絡) \n \n Bus topology(總線拓撲) \n Usually a cable is used to pass through the area that needs network connection, and every device that wants to connect to the network is connected through the cable. The device uses a T-connector or vampire tap to insert the cable. Although the bus topology is an older technology that is no longer used physically, it can still be implemented as a logic in some cases. \n 通常使用一根電纜穿過需要網絡連接的區域，每個希望連接到網絡的設備都通過該電纜連接。設備使用T型連接器或吸血鬼抽頭插入電纜。儘管總線拓撲是一項較舊的技術，在物理上已不再使用，但在某些情況下仍可以作為邏輯實現。 \n Ring topology(環形拓撲) \n Using cables running in a loop loop, each device is connected to the loop. Data travels in a single direction on the ring. The most common is used with backbone fiber optic networks. Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a set of standards used to transmit data on fiber optic lines in LANs. Each device waits for it to communicate on the token ring by passing tokens around the token ring. A ring topology network is also called a token ring network. Because there are two counter-rotating rings, FDDI tends to provide more redundancy than standard bus topologies. However, in most LANs, bus topology and ring topology are quickly replaced by star topology. \n 使用在環形迴路中運行的電纜，每個設備都連接到環形。數據在環上沿單個方向傳播。最常見的是與骨幹光纖網絡一起使用。光纖分佈式數據接口（FDDI）是用於在LAN中的光纖線上傳輸數據的一組標準。每個設備都通過在令牌環周圍傳遞令牌來等待其在令牌環上進行通信。環形拓撲網絡也稱為令牌環網絡。由於有兩個反向旋轉的環，因此FDDI傾向於提供比標準總線拓撲更多的冗餘。但是，在大多數LAN中，總線拓撲和環形拓撲都很快被星形拓撲取代。 \n Star topology(星型拓撲) \n The star topology is the most common topology. Almost all LANs use a star topology. All devices in the star topology are connected to one point. A single connection point can be a hub or switch. In most modern networks, the single connection point will be a switch. Star topologies are the main physical topologies today, although they are not always used as logical topologies. Fiber optic connections can also be used for high-speed or high-security networks. The disadvantage of the star topology is that it will cause a single point of failure. If a central device (such as a switch) fails, the entire network will also fail. Different from the bus and ring network varieties, the star topology has the advantages of reducing costs and being easy to expand. \n 星形拓撲是最常見的拓撲。幾乎所有局域網都使用星型拓撲。星型拓撲的所有設備都連接到一個點。單個連接點可以是集線器或交換機。在大多數現代網絡中，單個連接點將是一個交換機。星形拓撲是當今主要的物理拓撲，儘管它們並不總是用作邏輯拓撲。光纖連接也可以用於高速或高安全性網絡。星形拓撲的缺點是會造成單點故障。如果中央設備（如交換機）發生故障，整個網絡也會失敗。與總線和環形網絡品種不同，星形拓撲結構具有減少費用並易於擴展的優勢。 \n Full mesh topology(全網狀拓撲) \n In order to solve the redundancy problem, a full mesh topology was created. So far, this topology is the most redundant and expensive topology because every node or workstation in the network is directly connected to every other node, but it is very expensive to maintain and operate. \n 為了解決冗餘問題，創建了全網狀拓撲。到目前為止，此拓撲是最冗餘，最昂貴的拓撲，因為網絡中的每個節點或工作站都直接連接到每個其他節點，但維護和操作非常昂貴。 \n Partial mesh topology(部分網格拓撲) \n In order to solve the cost problem created by the full mesh topology, a partial mesh topology was created. Part of the mesh topology is actually a hybrid full mesh topology. Provides redundancy and optimal routing between certain sites, while avoiding the overhead of connecting each site. \n 為了解決由全網格拓撲創建的成本問題，創建了部分網格拓撲。部分網狀拓撲實際上是混合全網狀拓撲。提供了某些站點之間的冗餘和最佳路由，同時避免了連接每個站點的開銷。 \n Network hardware(網路硬件) \n 網絡設備根據其用途而有所不同。各種設備，例如集線器，交換機，路由器，網橋，網絡適配器和媒體。 \n Network equipment varies according to its purpose. Various devices such as hubs, switches, routers, bridges, network adapters and media. \n hub(樞紐) \n A hub is one of the simplest network devices. It connects multiple network devices and workstations to each other to form a network. It works by receiving a signal in one port and rebroadcasting the signal to all other ports. Hubs can be divided into two types: active or passive. The active hub repeats the received signal on all its ports and amplifies the signal to its maximum strength. Passive hubs only repeat the signal without adding any amplification. Hubs are an older technology that can be used to easily increase the number of available ports, but cause too many network errors and conflicts. There are newer variants of hubs, called smart hubs. \n The three basic types of Ethernet hubs are as follows: \n Passive hub-repeat signal without amplification Active Hub – Repeatedly amplify the signal Smart Hub-Active hub with enhanced functions (for example: SNMP) \n There is no inherent security designed inside the hub, but all information received from one port is rebroadcasted to another port. Essentially, the hub only relies on the connected workstation to "listen" to information on its port (if the information is specifically for that workstation). When the information is not sent to it, the workstation should just ignore the data. \n 集線器是最簡單的網絡設備之一，將多個網絡設備和工作站相互連接，形成一個網絡，通過在一個端口中接收信號並將該信號重新廣播到其所有其他端口來工作。集線器可以分為主動或被動兩種。活動集線器會在其所有端口上重複接收到的信號，並將該信號放大到最大強度。無源集線器僅重複信號不增加任何放大。集線器是一種較舊的技術，可用於輕鬆增加可用端口的數量，但導致過多的網絡錯誤和衝突。集線器有較新的變體，稱為智能集線器。 \n 以太網集線器的三種基本類型如下： \n 無源集線器–重複信號而不放大 有源集線器–重複放大信號 智能集線器–具有增強功能的活動集線器（例如：SNMP） \n 集線器內部沒有設計固有的安全性，只是將從一個端口接收的所有信息重新廣播到另一個端口。本質上，集線器僅依賴於連接的工作站來“偵聽”其端口上的信息（如果該信息專門針對該工作站）。當信息沒有發送給它時，工作站應該只是忽略數據。 \n Bridge(橋梁) \n The hub functions in a single conflict domain to operate together. A network device that can break the conflict domain into smaller units is needed to help the network operate more efficiently. This interconnection of multiple network segments makes the network Can be extended to large networks without significantly reducing the performance of the network. The bridge is smarter than the hub, and is actually analyzing the source, the media access control (MAC) address, and the MAC address for the unique identifier of the network interface for communication. In the frames entering the bridge, the internal MAC table is filled according to these addresses. Future routing decisions will be based on those destination MAC addresses. By only forwarding information to the root hub associated with the network device, this intelligent forwarding based on the target MAC address in the frame can reduce network traffic. \n 集線器在單個衝突域中起作用的設備一起運行，需要一個可以將該衝突域分解為較小單元的網絡設備，以幫助網絡更高效地運行，多個網段的這種互連在一起使網絡可以擴展到大型網絡，而不會顯著降低該網絡的性能。橋比集線器更智能，實際上是在分析源、媒體訪問控制（MAC）地址MAC地址給網絡接口進行通信的唯一標識符。在進入網橋的幀中，並根據這些地址填充內部MAC表。未來的路由決策將基於那些目標MAC地址。通過僅將信息轉發到與網絡設備關聯的根集線器，這種基於幀中目標MAC地址的智能轉發可減少網絡流量。 \n switch(開關) \n The switch is used to connect multiple network segments together, and each port on the switch acts as its own conflict domain. Each port on the switch works like a hub, with a bridge that connects the port of the hub to the workstation, thereby reducing the chance of network conflicts to zero. \n Switches are smart devices. They make forwarding decisions based on the MAC addresses they learn and place them in their MAC tables. The switch will analyze the source MAC address when it is input, and then fill in the source MAC address in the form of a frame to match the switch port. This allows the switch to forward frames only to the correct device on a single switch port, thereby improving security and network speed. \n 交換機用於將多個網段連接在一起，交換機上的每個端口都充當其自己的衝突域。交換機上的每個端口都像是集線器一樣工作，帶有將集線器的端口連接到工作站的網橋，從而將網絡衝突的機會降低到零。 \n 交換機是智能設備，它們根據其學習到的MAC地址並將其放置在其MAC表中做出轉發決定。交換機在輸入源MAC地址時會對其進行分析，然後以幀的形式填充源MAC地址，以使其與交換機端口匹配。這允許交換機僅將幀轉發到單個交換機端口上的正確設備，從而提高安全性和網絡速度。 \n router(路由器) \n The router separates network segments according to IP addresses, and forwards data packets out of the network segment only during configuration. The broadcast domain created by the switch can be decomposed and it is up to network professionals to configure the router to connect different networks together and perform intelligent routing decisions. The router has the closest relationship with the computer because it has a processor and a complex operating system. The router compares the IP addresses of the source and destination of the packet, and forwards traffic to or from the network based on this logical address (for example, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses). Routers are usually feature-rich devices and support multiple interface types, including unshielded twisted pair, optical fiber, and coaxial cable connections. Like a switch, each port on the router is a separate collision domain. Using access control lists, routers can block access to the network based on ports or addresses. This blocking increases the security of the network. \n 路由器根據IP地址將網段分開，並且僅在配置時將數據包轉發出網段。可以分解由交換機創建的廣播域由網絡專業人員決定將路由器配置為將不同的網絡連接在一起並執行智能路由決策。路由器與計算機的關係最為密切，因為它具有處理器和復雜的操作系統。路由器比較數據包源和目標的IP地址，並基於此邏輯地址（例如，IPv4和IPv6地址）將流量轉發到網絡或從網絡轉發流量。路由器通常是功能豐富的設備，並且支持多種接口類型，包括非屏蔽雙絞線，光纖和同軸電纜連接。像交換機一樣，路由器上的每個端口都是一個單獨的衝突域。使用訪問控制列表，路由器可以根據端口或地址阻止對網絡的訪問。這種阻塞增加了網絡的安全性。 \n network adapter(網絡適配器) \n The network adapter is used to connect the workstation to the network by using media. The network adapter can be built into the motherboard of the device in several ways: \n 1. Use integrated port clustering. 2. Add to the workstation by using the internal expansion card (PCIe, PCI or mini-PCIe). 3. By using an externally connected card, such as USB or PCMCIA. 4. There are two main types of network adapters: wired and wireless. The cable card supports various cable types. \n 網絡適配器用於通過使用媒體將工作站連接到網絡。可以通過幾種方式將網絡適配器內置到設備的主板中： \n 1.使用集成端口集群。 2.通過使用內部擴展卡（PCIe，PCI或mini-PCIe）添加到工作站。 3.通過使用外部連接的卡，例如USB或PCMCIA。 4.網絡適配器有兩種主要類型：有線和無線。有線卡支持各種電纜類型。 \n media(媒體) \n Media is a term used to classify the physical connection between two device ports. The medium consists of copper cables, optical cables and even radio frequency waves. The cost of the medium varies greatly, from the free cost of radio waves to the cheap price of unshielded twisted pair (copper cable) to the expensive price of fiber optic cables. The type of media determines the bandwidth speed, capacity and distance limits of a particular network. \n 媒體是用於對兩個設備端口之間的物理連接進行分類的術語。介質由銅纜，光纜甚至射頻波組成。介質的成本差異很大，從無線電波的免費成本到非屏蔽雙絞線（銅纜）的價格便宜，再到光纖電纜的價格昂貴。媒體的類型確定特定網絡的帶寬速度，容量和距離限制。 \n Internet media(網路媒體) \n Optical fiber cables, discuss twisted pair cables and coaxial cables. For each cable type, the appearance, characteristics and types of the connector, as well as speed and limitations. \n 光纖電纜，討論雙絞線電纜和同軸電纜。對於每種電纜類型、連接器的外觀、特性和類型以及速度和限制。 \n optic fibre cable(光纖電纜) \n Fiber optic cables are constructed by using a glass core in the center of the cable, which is surrounded by a cladding. To send data from one end of the cable to the other, light from a light emitting diode (LED) or laser can be used to transmit the signal down the glass fiber in the center of the cable. Since data is transmitted through light and is not affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI), electromagnetic interference will affect traditional copper-based cables such as twisted pair and coaxial cables. Optical fiber has the ability to transmit data over long distances (many miles) without the use of repeaters. Large bandwidth and information that travels at the speed of light can also carry large amounts of data. Bandwidth can be measured in gigabits or even terabits per second. \n Multimode fiber optic cable (MMF): \n The core wire is larger than a single-mode optical cable. The core size of the multimode fiber is 62.5 microns. Micrometer is a very small unit of measurement, actually even smaller than the width of a human hair. The larger core of the MMF enables multiple propagation modes from one end of the cable to the other. In this way, a single fiber can transmit multiple signals on it, and each signal is transmitted with a slightly different reflection angle. When the light reaches the destination, the signal is then converted back to 1 and 0 and passed to the computer through the network interface card. Multimode optical fiber is usually used in shorter distance optical fiber connections, such as from router to switch, from switch to switch or from server to switch. \n Single-mode fiber optic cable (SMF) \n : The core wire is much smaller than the multimode optical cable. The core size of SMF is 10 microns. The smaller core of the SMF allows only a single mode of propagation of light from one end of the cable to the other. This through connection allows data to be transmitted over longer distances without a repeater than using MMF. When the light reaches the destination, the signal is then converted back to 1 and 0 and passed to the computer through the network interface card. Single-mode fiber is usually used for ultra-long-distance fiber connections, such as backbone connections from one local area network to another. \n 光纖電纜是通過在電纜的中心使用玻璃芯構成的，該玻璃芯被包層圍繞。將數據從電纜的一端發送到另一端，可使用來自發光二極管（LED）或激光的光沿電纜中心的玻璃纖維向下傳輸信號。由於數據是通過光傳輸的，不受電磁干擾（EMI）的影響，電磁干擾會影響傳統的銅基電纜，如雙絞線和同軸電纜。光纖具有無需使用中繼器就可以很遠的距離（許多英里）發送數據的能力。大帶寬和以光速傳播的信息，還可以攜帶大量數據。帶寬可以每秒千兆比特或什至兆兆比特來度量。 \n 多模光纜（MMF）: \n 芯線比單模光纜大。多模光纖的纖芯尺寸為62.5微米。微米是非常小的度量單位，實際上甚至比人類頭髮的寬度還小。MMF的較大芯線實現了從電纜一端到另一端的多種傳播模式。這樣一來，單根光纖就可以在其上傳輸多個信號，而每個信號都以稍微不同的反射角傳輸。當光線到達目的地時，信號然後被轉換回1和0，並通過網絡接口卡傳遞到計算機。多模光纖通常用於較短距離的光纖連接中，例如從路由器到交換機，從交換機到交換機或從服務器到交換機。 \n 單模光纜（SMF） \n :芯線比多模光纜小得多。SMF的芯尺寸為10微米。SMF的較小芯線僅允許光從電纜一端到另一端的單一傳播模式。這種直通連接允許數據在沒有中繼器的情況下傳輸的距離比使用MMF傳輸的距離更長。當光線到達目的地時，信號然後被轉換回1和0，並通過網絡接口卡傳遞到計算機。單模光纖通常用於超長距離的光纖連接中，例如從一個局域網到另一個局域網的骨干連接。 \n \n Fiber optic cable connector(光纖電纜連接器) \n Fiber optic cables belong to only the above two types: single-mode and multi-mode. However, there are four types at the end of each cable. \n User connector (SC) is a fiber optic cable connector, similar to ordinary audio and video cables, it uses a push-pull mechanism to lock into the port. If you want to enable two-way transmission to send and receive data, you need two fiber optic cables, so dual SC connectors are sometimes used. \n Straight (ST) connectors are fiber optic cable connectors that use bayonet plugs and sockets. It is the first de facto standard connector for most commercial wiring using fiber optic cables and is very common in fiber optic networks. \n The Lucent connector (LC) is a miniature version of the fiber optic SC connector. It looks a bit like SC, but only half the size, only 1.25mm instead of 2.5mm ferrule, so it is very useful when connecting multiple devices in a small area (such as the front panel of a 24-port switch). \n The mechanical transmission registration jack (MT-RJ) connector is a fiber optic cable connector, which is very popular in small devices due to its small size. The connector accommodates two optical fibers and mates with the positioning pins on the plug. These connectors are usually found to connect the switch to the patch panel because the front panels of both devices have a limited area. \n 光纖電纜僅屬於上述兩種類型：單模和多模。但是，每條電纜的末端都有四種。 \n 用戶連接器（SC）是一種光纖電纜連接器，類似於普通的音頻和視頻電纜，它使用推挽機制鎖入端口。如果要啟用雙向傳輸以發送和接收數據，則需要兩條光纖電纜，因此有時會使用雙SC連接器。 \n 筆直（ST）連接器是使用卡口插頭和插座的光纖電纜連接器。它是大多數使用光纖電纜進行商業佈線的第一個事實上的標準連接器，在光纖網絡中非常常見。 \n 朗訊連接器（LC）是光纖SC連接器的微型版本。它看上去有點像SC，但尺寸只有一半，只有1.25毫米而不是2.5毫米的插芯，因此在小區域（例如24端口交換機的前面板）連接多個設備時非常有用。 \n 機械傳輸註冊插孔（MT-RJ）連接器是一種光纖電纜連接器，由於其尺寸小，在小型設備中非常受歡迎。該連接器容納兩根光纖，並與插頭上的定位銷配對。通常發現這些連接器將開關連接到配線架，因為兩個設備的前面板都有有限的區域。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923233 UNIT 3~4 Page 73~84.html'}, {'title': '40923237 UNIT 4\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 85~96', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923237 UNIT 4\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 85~96.html'}, {'title': '40923243 UNIT 4\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 97~108', 'text': '\n Overview(總覽) \n In this lesson, we will discuss TCP/IP, and the two common types of Internet addressing: Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6). We will discuss IPv4 in depth, as it is still the most dominant version in use in our networks. Then, we will cover the specifics of IPv6, differences between IPv4 and IPv6, and the reason we are moving toward IPv6 in the future. \n 在本課程中，我們將討論TCP / IP以及Internet尋址的兩種常見類型：Internet協議版本4（IPv4）和Internet協議版本6（IPv6）。我們將深入討論IPv4，因為它仍然是我們網絡中使用的最主要版本。然後，我們將介紹IPv6的細節，IPv4與IPv6之間的差異以及將來向IPv6過渡的原因。 \n TCP IP \n Computer networks — including the Internet, which is the largest computer network — use Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol or TCP/IP for network communications both internally on a LAN/WAN and externally to the Internet. \n TCP/IP provides end-to-end connectivity of data. TCP/IP specifies how data should be grouped, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination address. The TCP/IP model, along with many of its protocols, is maintained and managed by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). \n TCP/IP is one of two sets of protocols that collectively operate in the transport and network layers of the OSI model. \n In addition to creating message segments and ensuring connectivity, some of the basic characteristics of the IP protocol ensure that datagrams are routed to the correct destination using a binary addressing scheme. While the process of how the IP addresses are derived from binary (and hexadecimal relationships) is not covered in this course, it is important to know that just as computer CPUs use binary numbers to process data, networking hardware and protocols do so as well. \n 計算機網絡（包括最大的計算機網絡Internet）使用傳輸控制協議/ Internet協議或TCP / IP進行內部LAN / WAN上和外部Internet的網絡通信。 \n TCP / IP提供數據的端到端連接。TCP / IP指定如何在目標地址處對數據進行分組，尋址，傳輸，路由和接收。TCP / IP模型及其許多協議由IETF（Internet工程任務組）維護和管理。 \n TCP / IP是在OSI模型的傳輸層和網絡層中共同運行的兩組協議之一。 \n 除了創建消息段並確保連接性之外，IP協議的某些基本特徵還可以確保使用二進制尋址方案將數據報路由到正確的目的地。儘管本課程未介紹如何從二進制（和十六進制關係）派生IP地址的過程，但重要的是要知道，就像計算機CPU使用二進制數來處理數據一樣，網絡硬件和協議也是如此。 \n IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses \n Network devices require a logical address — either an IPv4 or IPv6 address (see the network layer in the diagram above) — when moving data from one network segment to another. As we discussed in previous modules, switches make their intelligent switching decisions (see the data link layer in the diagram above based on media access control (MAC) addresses. The MAC address, also known as the physical address, is the unique identifier hard coded on a network interface card by the manufacturer. Switches use these MAC addresses to identify which devices are on which switch ports, and forward traffic within the network segment to the correct ports based on these addresses. When data traffic needs to cross the boundaries of the network, it requires a logical address that the router can use to make intelligent routing decisions. In most modern networks, this is done by using TCP/IP addressing. Historically, other protocols existed, such as internetwork packet exchange/sequenced packet exchange (IPX/SPX) for Novell networks, AppleTalk, and NetBEUI for Microsoft networks. TCP/IP replaced these protocols almost exclusively due to its robust nature, reliability, and availability. \n While the majority of our networks today still use IPv4, many networks are migrating to the newer IPv6 addressing standards. Additionally, many networks are offering dual support to both IPv4 and IPv6 during the transition. The reason for this transition is that we were running out of valid IPv4 addresses. IPv4 uses a 32-bit addressing scheme, providing only 4.2 billion available addresses, but IPv6 uses a 128-bit addressing scheme. IPv6 allows for 2128addresses, or 340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (3.4 x 1038) unique IP addresses. IPv6 allows for more IP addresses than humanity could ever utilize. At least that is what we think right now. \n 將數據從一個網段移動到另一個網段時，網絡設備需要邏輯地址-IPv4或IPv6地址（請參見上圖中的網絡層）。正如我們在之前的模塊中討論的那樣，交換機做出明智的交換決策（請參見上圖中的數據鏈路層，基於媒體訪問控制（MAC）地址。MAC地址，也稱為物理地址，是唯一的硬編碼標識符）交換機使用這些MAC地址來識別哪些設備在哪個交換機端口上，然後根據這些地址將網段內的流量轉發到正確的端口。在網絡中，它需要邏輯地址，路由器可以使用該邏輯地址來做出智能路由決策。在大多數現代網絡中，這是通過使用TCP / IP尋址完成的。從歷史上看，存在其他協議，例如Novell網絡的互聯網絡數據包交換/排序數據包交換（IPX / SPX），Apple網絡的AppleTalk和NetBEUI。由於TCP / IP的魯棒性，可靠性和可用性，它們幾乎完全取代了這些協議。 \n 儘管當今我們的大多數網絡仍使用IPv4，但許多網絡正在遷移到更新的IPv6尋址標準。此外，在過渡期間，許多網絡都對IPv4和IPv6提供雙重支持。進行此轉換的原因是我們用盡了有效的IPv4地址。IPv4使用32位尋址方案，僅提供42億個可用地址，而IPv6使用128位尋址方案。IPv6允許2 128地址或340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000（3.4×10 38）的唯一的IP地址。IPv6提供的IP地址超出了人類所能利用的範圍。至少這就是我們現在的想法。 \n Addressing Notation 尋址符號 \n Internet protocol (IP) networking relies on both an IP address and subnet mask using a 32-bit dotted decimal notation. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) developed and maintains the standards for IP allocation and protocols. \n Internet協議（IP）網絡使用32位點分十進製表示法同時依賴IP地址和子網掩碼。互聯網工程任務組（IETF）和互聯網名稱與數字地址分配機構（ICANN）制定並維護了IP分配和協議的標準。 \n Each octet is made up of eight bits (one byte or two nibbles); multiplied by four octets, that equals 32 bits. The maximum value for any octet is 255 (28-1) so therefore the maximum number of IPv4 addresses available is 232, which equals 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. \n The presence of the subnet mask tells networking devices how much of the IP address belongs to the network and how much to the host. The 255.255.255.0 subnet represents that the first three octets are the network and the “0” represents the available number of hosts (nodes). So, the form is N.N.N.H. Think of the combination of IP and subnet as similar to regular postal addresses. You need a zip code (subnet) and street address (host). \n There are five different classes in IPv4 labelled A through E, with classes A, B, and C used by computer networks and classes D and E reserved as experimental. As originally designed, the IP range is determined by the lead bits in the first octet and matched to one specific subnet mask. This is called "classful" addressing. When the IP class does not match the default subnet mask, it is called "classless." \n 每個八位位組由八位組成（一個字節或兩個半字節）。乘以四個八位位組，等於32位。任何八位位組的最大值為255（2 8 -1），因此可用的IPv4地址的最大數量為2 32，等於4,294,967,296個唯一地址。 \n 子網掩碼的存在告訴網絡設備多少IP地址屬於網絡，多少屬於主機。255.255.255.0子網表示前三個八位位組是網絡，“ 0”表示可用的主機（節點）數。因此，形式為NNNH。將IP和子網的組合視為類似於常規郵政地址。您需要一個郵政編碼（子網）和街道地址（主機）。 \n IPv4中有五種不同的類別，標記為A到E，計算機網絡使用的類別為A，B和C，D和E類別保留為實驗性。按照最初的設計，IP範圍由第一個八位位組中的前導位確定，並與一個特定的子網掩碼匹配。這稱為“有類”尋址。如果IP類與默認子網掩碼不匹配，則稱為“無類”。 \n \n Network and Host Addresses\xa0 網絡和主機地址 \n An IPv4 network address is further divided into two portions based upon the subnet mask: the network portion and the host portion. A subnet mask is a series of numbers used for routing traffic within a subnetwork. When a subnet mask is used to define the network portion, anywhere there is a binary “11111111” (or 255 in decimal) used, this area is considered part of the network portion. When a binary “00000000” (0 in decimal) is used, this represents the host portion of the address. The host represents a single device on the network, such as your computer or phone. \n IPv4網絡地址根據子網掩碼進一步分為兩部分：網絡部分和主機部分。子網掩碼是用於在子網內路由流量的一系列數字。當使用子網掩碼定義網絡部分時，在任何使用二進制“ 11111111”（或十進制255）的地方，該區域均被視為網絡部分的一部分。當使用二進制“ 00000000”（十進制為0）時，它表示地址的主機部分。主機代表網絡上的單個設備，例如您的計算機或電話。 \n As you can see, when the subnet mask has a 255 in it, it is defining the network portion of the address. In class A addresses, the first octet defines the network, and the last three define the host. In class B addresses, the first two octets define the network, the last two define the host. In class C addresses, the first three octets define the network, the last one defines the host. \n 如您所見，當子網掩碼中包含255時，它定義了地址的網絡部分。在A類地址中，第一個八位位組定義網絡，最後三個八位位組定義主機。在B類地址中，前兩個八位位組定義網絡，後兩個定義主機。在C類地址中，前三個八位位組定義網絡，最後一個八位位組定義主機。 \n Subnet masks are used to define the specific network we are referencing. A standard class A subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 is used for all networks where the first octet starts with a number between 1 and 126. \n 子網掩碼用於定義我們要引用的特定網絡。255.0.0.0的標準A類子網掩碼適用於所有第一個八位位組以1到126之間的數字開頭的網絡。 \n Therefore, this address fits into the class A category. In this course, we only deal with “classful” subnet masks — the ones that only contain values of 255 and 0. In future courses, you may see other subnet masks used to further break apart the networks. \n 因此，該地址屬於A類類別。在本課程中，我們僅處理“有類”子網掩碼-僅包含255和0的值。在以後的課程中，您可能會看到其他子網掩碼用於進一步拆分網絡。 \n To route your traffic over the Internet, you are required to have a publically routable IP address. These addresses are globally managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). If you desire to have one of these addresses, you must purchase them for use to ensure no one else has that specific number. For most users, this is done for you by your Internet service provider (ISP), but if you have a need for numerous public IP addresses, you can buy a block of them from ICANN. \n Private IP addresses, on the other hand, can be used by anyone without any prior coordination. This is because private IP addresses are not routable over the Internet and are only used inside your local area network. For example, at your home, you may have five computers hooked up to your switch and those machines are all using private IP addresses. When you make a request to go outside the network, like to visit a college’s website, your router performs a network address translation (NAT) that allows your private IP address to be converted into a public IP address and a port, which then makes the request on your behalf. There is a specific range of IP addresses that are reserved as private for internal use (by you and others). \n 要通過Internet路由流量，您需要具有可公共路由的IP地址。這些地址由互聯網名稱與數字地址分配機構（ICANN）全局管理。如果您希望擁有這些地址之一，則必須購買它們以確保沒有其他人擁有該特定號碼。對於大多數用戶而言，這是由Internet服務提供商（ISP）為您完成的，但是如果您需要大量的公共IP地址，則可以從ICANN購買其中的一部分。 \n 另一方面，任何人都可以使用私有IP地址，而無需事先協調。這是因為專用IP地址無法通過Internet路由，而只能在局域網內使用。例如，在家裡，您可能有五台計算機連接到交換機，而這些計算機都使用私有IP地址。當您發出訪問網絡的請求（例如訪問大學的網站）時，路由器會執行網絡地址轉換（NAT），該轉換可將您的私有IP地址轉換為公共IP地址和端口，從而使代表您提出要求。有一個特定範圍的IP地址保留為私有（供您和他人使用）供內部使用。 \n IPv4 Data Flows IPv4數據流 \n In Internet protocol version 4, there are three types of data flows that can occur: unicast, broadcast, and multicast. \n The most common and most widely used is called unicast. In unicast communication, data travels from a single device to another single device on the network. For example, when you go to www.google.com in your web browser, your computer makes a request to one of Google’s web servers using unicast communication, and one of Google’s computers then sends the data back using unicast communication to just your computer. \n 在Internet協議版本4中，可以發生三種類型的數據流：單播，廣播和多播。 \n 最常見和最廣泛使用的方法稱為單播。在單播通信中，數據從網絡上的單個設備傳輸到另一個單個設備。例如，當您在網絡瀏覽器中訪問www.google.com時，您的計算機使用單播通信向一台Google的Web服務器發出請求，然後一台Google的計算機通過單播通信將數據發送回您的計算機。 \n When data is sent as a broadcast communication, it travels from a single device (such as your computer) to every other device on the network. This data will not travel outside the current subnet, though, when using broadcast. An example of broadcast communications would be if your system administrator was going to shut down a switch for maintenance. She may send out a broadcast message to everyone connected to that switch, warning them that their connectivity is going to be lost in the next ten minutes. You can think of this type of messaging like a teacher who is about to announce the next homework assignment. The teacher may say (or broadcast), “Class, here is your homework for tonight.” The message is directed at everyone in the class (or subnet) and they all should receive the message. \n 當數據作為廣播通信發送時，它從單個設備（例如您的計算機）傳輸到網絡上的所有其他設備。但是，使用廣播時，該數據不會在當前子網之外傳播。例如，如果您的系統管理員要關閉交換機進行維護，則為廣播通信。她可能會向連接到該交換機的每個人發出廣播消息，警告他們在接下來的十分鐘內將失去連接。您可以將這種消息傳遞想像為即將宣布下一個作業的老師。老師可能會說（或廣播）“課，這是你今晚的作業”。該消息針對班級（或子網）中的每個人，他們所有人都應該收到該消息。 \n The final method of data travel is called multicast. In multicast communication, data travels from a single device to multiple other devices on the network, but not necessarily to all of them, like it does when using broadcast communication. Also, this can expand outside of a single subnet. This works well when sharing a resource, such as streaming video. You can think of this type of communication as the Internet equivalent of watching satellite TV. For satellite TV, the signal is being sent out, but you have to “tune in” in order to receive (view) the data. \n Benefits of IPv6 IPv6的好處 \n IPv6 has many benefits over IPv4, the biggest of which is the number of available IP addresses. In IPv6, there is no broadcast provided, which frees up IP addresses, reduces the amount of traffic sent over the network, and increases bandwidth. Also, IPv6 doesn’t allow packets to be fragmented (broken into pieces) during transmission. This is handled by the protocol by resizing the maximum transmission unit size each time a session is created between two devices. \n A major benefit of IPv6 is that it allows for dual stack implementation, which means that IPv4 and IPv6 can run simultaneously on a device and provide service to the device from either protocol without conflict. IPv6 can also run on top of IPv4 as a tunneled protocol, thereby allowing it to run over older devices, as well. \n Lastly, the packet headers in IPv6 are much simpler than in IPv4. In IPv4, there are 12 fields that must be completely filled out (adding to overhead and complexity), but in IPv6 this was reduced to the bare minimum of five fields. This includes fields such as source and destination address, as well as quality of service priority. \n 與IPv4相比，IPv6有很多好處，其中最大的好處就是可用IP地址的數量。在IPv6中，沒有提供廣播，這釋放了IP地址，減少了通過網絡發送的流量，並增加了帶寬。此外，IPv6不允許在傳輸過程中將數據包分段（分成多個部分）。協議通過每次在兩個設備之間創建會話時調整最大傳輸單元大小來解決此問題。 \n IPv6的一個主要優點是它允許雙棧實現，這意味著IPv4和IPv6可以在設備上同時運行，並可以從任一協議向設備提供服務而不會發生衝突。IPv6還可以作為隧道協議在IPv4之上運行，從而也可以在較舊的設備上運行。 \n 最後，IPv6中的數據包頭比IPv4中的數據包頭簡單得多。在IPv4中，必須完全填寫12個字段（增加了開銷和復雜性），但是在IPv6中，此字段減少到最少五個字段。這包括諸如源地址和目標地址以及服務質量優先級之類的字段。 \n IPv6 Address Structure IPv6地址結構 \n While IPv6 has numerous improvements over IPv4, the most notable thing about IPv6 that people see is the format of the address. Instead of the dotted-decimal notation we used in IPv4 with addresses like 192.168.1.1, IPv6 uses eight groupings of four hexadecimal digits in each group. Each group is then broken apart by a colon (:). An example of an IPv6 address is 2002:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:4815:54ae. \n A hexadecimal digit allows for counting from zero to 15 using the digits 0-9, then the letters A through F. Each hexadecimal digit replaces four binary digits (or four 1s and 0s), allowing us to write an IPv6 address using (at most) 32 hexadecimal digits. \n Luckily, the creators of IPv6 allowed for a shorthand. First, anytime there are leading zeros, they can be dropped. This is equivalent to dropping the leading zeros in the number 0010 to 10. The numbers are equivalent, as long as the zeros are in front of the other digits. The second shorthand technique involves several groupings of four zeros. When multiple groupings of four zeros are present, they can be represented by a double colon (::). Note that you can only use the double colon once per address, because the only way to know how many sets of zeros you’ve replaced with the double colon is to compare the shorthand address with the total number of bits available. \n 儘管IPv6相對於IPv4進行了許多改進，但是人們看到的關於IPv6的最值得注意的事情是地址的格式。IPv6不是在IPv4中使用像192.168.1.1這樣的地址使用的點分十進製表示法，而是在每個組中使用四個十六進制數字組成的八組。然後，每個組用冒號（:)分隔。IPv6地址的示例是2002：0000：0000：0000：0000：0000：0000：4815：54ae。 \n 十六進制數字允許使用數字0-9（從字母A到F）從零到15進行計數。每個十六進制數字都替換了四個二進制數字（或四個1和0），從而允許我們使用（最多）32個十六進制數字。 \n 幸運的是，IPv6的創建者允許使用簡寫形式。首先，只要有前導零，就可以將其丟棄。這等效於將數字0010中的前導零刪除為10。這些數字是等效的，只要零在其他數字的前面即可。第二種速記技術涉及四個零的幾個分組。當存在四個零的多個分組時，可以用雙冒號（：:)表示。請注意，每個地址只能使用雙冒號一次，因為知道用雙冒號替換了多少組零的唯一方法是將速記地址與可用位數進行比較。 \n IPv6 Data Flows\xa0 \xa0IPv6數據流 \n Data flows in IPv6 are similar to those in IPv4. In fact, unicast and multicast work identical to their IPv4 counterparts. But, because there is no broadcast in IPv6, it has been replaced with “anycast.” Anycast allows data to travel from a single source device to the nearest of multiple, but specific, devices on a network. Anycasting is designed to let one host initiate the efficient updating of router tables for a group of hosts. IPv6 can determine which gateway host is closest and sends the packets to that host as though it were a unicast communication. In turn, that host can anycast to another host in the group until all routing tables are updated. \n IPv6中的數據流類似於IPv4中的數據流。實際上，單播和多播的工作方式與IPv4相同。但是，由於IPv6中沒有廣播，因此已將其替換為“任何廣播”。Anycast允許數據從單個源設備傳輸到網絡上多個（但特定的）設備中最接近的一個。任意廣播旨在讓一個主機為一組主機啟動路由器表的有效更新。IPv6可以確定哪個網關主機最接近，並將數據包發送到該主機，就好像它是單播通信一樣。相應地，該主機可以向組中的另一台主機任意廣播，直到更新所有路由表為止。 \n The IP address always determines the class of a network and never the subnet. When the IP addresses match, the network is said to be using a “classful” scheme. However, this allows for many wasted IP addresses when a company needs more publicly routable IP addresses than the address class they are using offers. Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) was developed in order to make the IP addressing scheme more efficient and to delay the depletion of IPv4 addresses. Essentially, some of the network bits in the default subnet mask are borrowed and used for the host portion of the network. For example, if a business needs 300 public IP addresses, then class C addresses would be too small because of the 254 device limitation, and class B would be excessively large. With CIDR, a business could be assigned an IP address range with a subnet of 255.255.254.0/23. In CIDR notation, “/23” indicates that the first 23 bits of the address are the network part of the address, which leaves the last nine bits for host addresses, rather than the eight bits that would be available in classful addressing. That means there will now be 510 IP numbers available rather than 254. \n IP地址始終確定網絡的類別，而不是子網。如果IP地址匹配，則稱網絡正在使用“分類”方案。但是，當公司需要比其使用的地址類別更多的可公共路由的IP地址時，這會浪費許多IP地址。開發無類域間路由（CIDR）是為了使IP尋址方案更有效並延遲IPv4地址的耗盡。本質上，默認子網掩碼中的某些網絡位被借用並用於網絡的主機部分。例如，如果一家企業需要300個公共IP地址，則由於254個設備限制，C類地址將太小，而B類將太大。使用CIDR，可以為企業分配一個IP地址範圍，其子網為255.255.254。0/23。在CIDR表示法中，“ / 23”表示地址的前23位是地址的網絡部分，剩下的最後9位用於主機地址，而不是分類尋址中可用的8位。這意味著現在將有510個IP號碼，而不是254個。 \n Private Vs. Public IP Addresses 私人vs. 公用IP地址 \n IPv4 depletion affects public addresses that are routable on the Internet by such devices as routers and servers, as well as the device used to connect your home to the Internet. Whether it is a cable modem, DSL, or FIOS, that device has a public IP address that communicates with your Internet service provider (ISP). This is an example of a WAN. The LAN (local area network) is wholly comprised of private IP addresses. \n IPv4耗盡會影響可通過路由器和服務器之類的設備以及用於將家庭連接到Internet的設備在Internet上路由的公用地址。無論是電纜調製解調器，DSL還是FIOS，該設備都具有與Internet服務提供商（ISP）通信的公共IP地址。這是WAN的示例。LAN（局域網）完全由專用IP地址組成。 \n In order for a LAN node to access the Internet, IPv4 uses network address translation (NAT), which is a technique where the gateway/router would replace the outgoing private IPv4 address with the publically routable address assigned by the ISP. \n 為了使LAN節點能夠訪問Internet，IPv4使用網絡地址轉換（NAT），這是網關/路由器將出站專用IPv4地址替換為ISP分配的可公開路由地址的技術。 \n Static Vs. Dynamic IP Addressing 靜態與 動態IP尋址 \n Historically, the client (a workstation or a printer) would be assigned a static IP address manually using the operating system IPv4 configuration. Remember, you must have unique IP addresses in any network. Imagine how difficult it was in a large corporation to track all the different nodes and IP addresses. Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) solves this problem by having one device (a server or a router) automatically assign an IP address. In the current network structure, you would still assign static IP addresses to devices that must have guaranteed connectivity: servers, routers, managed switches, etc. However, DHCP can provide many benefits in networking maintenance with the abundant wireless devices such as cell phones, tablets, and laptops coming in and out of a network daily. Companies have developed policies for employees to bring their own devices to work, thus accessing the corporate network. DHCP will give the client setup parameters (gateway, domain, and name servers), keeping a specific pool of IP addresses, and offering timed leases for a device’s IP assignment. \n 從歷史上看，將使用操作系統IPv4配置為客戶端（工作站或打印機）手動分配靜態IP地址。請記住，任何網絡中都必須具有唯一的IP地址。想像一下，在一家大公司中跟踪所有不同的節點和IP地址有多麼困難。動態主機配置協議（DHCP）通過讓一台設備（服務器或路由器）自動分配IP地址來解決此問題。在當前的網絡結構中，您仍將靜態IP地址分配給必須保證連接性的設備：服務器，路由器，受管理的交換機等。但是，DHCP可以通過大量的無線設備（例如手機，平板電腦和筆記本電腦每天進出網絡。公司已製定政策，要求員工使用自己的設備來工作，從而訪問公司網絡。DHCP將提供客戶端設置參數（網關，域和名稱服務器），保留特定的IP地址池，並為設備的IP分配提供定時租約。 \n \n APIPA\xa0 Link-Local\xa0 \xa0APIPA\xa0 本地鏈接 \n Link-local addresses are special addresses assigned by the operating system when either there is no statically assigned IP address, or the DHCP does not assign one to the network interface. Link-local addresses are not routable and only function in a LAN segment. In IPv4, the address range is 169.254.0.0/16 and the form is 169.254.x.x. In IPv6, the form is FE80::/64. In a Microsoft OS, the link-local address is referred to as automatic private IP addressing (APIPA). \n If you are troubleshooting an NIC (network interface card) that is supposed to be connected and you see a link-local address, this indicates that there is something wrong with the configuration because the OS assigned the address. \n 當沒有靜態分配的IP地址，或者DHCP沒有為網絡接口分配一個IP地址時，本地鏈接地址是操作系統分配的特殊地址。本地鏈接地址不可路由，只能在LAN網段中使用。在IPv4中，地址範圍為169.254.0.0/16，格式為169.254.xx。在IPv6中，格式為FE80 :: / 64。在Microsoft操作系統中，本地鏈接地址稱為自動專用IP尋址（APIPA）。 \n 如果要對應該連接的NIC（網絡接口卡）進行故障排除，並且看到鏈接本地地址，則表明配置有問題，因為操作系統分配了該地址。 \n Client-side DHCP\xa0 \xa0客戶端DHCP \n DHCP works by having an authoritative device, either a server or a router, offering to assign the IP address. In order for this to work, the client must be configured to look for the DHCP authority, and confirm that it will accept the IP assignment. These settings are located in “network connections” through either the network and sharing center or directly through the control panel. The configuration settings are located in the properties of the connection under either IPv4 or IPv6. \n DHCP通過擁有授權設備（服務器或路由器）來分配IP地址而起作用。為了使它起作用，必須將客戶端配置為尋找DHCP授權，並確認它將接受IP分配。這些設置通過網絡和共享中心位於“網絡連接”中，也可以直接通過控制面板位於“網絡連接”中。配置設置位於IPv4或IPv6下的連接屬性中。 \n Client-side DNS settings\xa0 \xa0客戶端DNS設置 \n The domain name system (DNS) is a part of the Internet protocol that translates IP addresses to name addresses. There is a setting located in the network properties section of the IPv4 or IPv6 property window that allows for the manual setting of the the domain name system (DNS) server address. The local DNS cache will keep a local record of IP address to name conversion for both LAN devices and Internet addresses. Alternate DNS server addresses can be added to the client to assist in name resolution, thus improving data flow. \n 域名系統（DNS）是Internet協議的一部分，該協議將IP地址轉換為名稱地址。IPv4或IPv6屬性窗口的網絡屬性部分中有一個設置，允許手動設置域名系統（DNS）服務器地址。本地DNS緩存將保留IP地址到LAN設備和Internet地址的名稱轉換的本地記錄。可以將備用DNS服務器地址添加到客戶端以幫助名稱解析，從而改善數據流。 \n Gateway 網關 \n The gateway is the device that connects different networks types together. In most SOHO (small office, home office) environments today, this is the router that connects the LAN to the ISP modem through the WAN port (cable, DSL, or FIOS), which provides Internet access. In a larger corporate environment, it is the last router in the LAN that connects to a WAN link, and then passes the IP packets to their destination. The difference is that in a larger corporate environment, there can be multiple LAN segments and routers between the client workstation and the gateway. \n 網關是將不同網絡類型連接在一起的設備。在當今的大多數SOHO（小型辦公室，家庭辦公室）環境中，這是通過WAN端口（電纜，DSL或FIOS）將LAN連接到ISP調製解調器的路由器，可以提供Internet訪問。在較大的公司環境中，它是LAN中的最後一個路由器，它連接到WAN鏈接，然後將IP數據包傳遞到其目的地。區別在於，在較大的公司環境中，客戶端工作站和網關之間可以有多個LAN網段和路由器。 \n Windows networking is nearly identical in all aspects from Vista through to Windows 10. To access the network settings, go to either the control panel, then “network and Internet,” then “network and sharing center,” or right-click the “open network and sharing center” icon in the system tray (next to the clock). \n 從Vista到Windows 10，Windows聯網在各個方面都幾乎相同。要訪問網絡設置，請轉到控制面板，然後依次單擊“網絡和Internet”，“網絡和共享中心”，或右鍵單擊“打開”。網絡和共享中心”圖標（位於時鐘旁邊）。 \n Remember, a technician will ensure settings fit the current network. Most networks are set up with DHCP, which will provide the workstation with an IP address, gateway, and DNS server address. \n Double-click the IPv4 properties dialogue box and set both radio buttons to “obtain (an IP address/DNS server address) automatically.” The window on the right in the image below allows for the APIPA address to be automatically assigned or for the user to configure a static IPv4 address. \n 請記住，技術人員將確保設置適合當前網絡。大多數網絡都設置有DHCP，它將為工作站提供IP地址，網關和DNS服務器地址。 \n 雙擊IPv4屬性對話框，並將兩個單選按鈕設置為“自動獲取（IP地址/ DNS服務器地址）”。下圖右側的窗口允許自動分配APIPA地址或允許用戶配置靜態IPv4地址。 \n Overview 總攬 \n In this lesson, we will discuss transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP), as well as their associated ports and protocols. We will specifically address the various email ports and protocols in use today, as well as discussing secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) in the context of web security. Then, we will discuss file transfer protocol (FTP) and hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and their use on the Internet today, as well as some older technologies such as Telnet and its more secure alternative, secure shell (SSH). \n 在本課程中，我們將討論傳輸控制協議（TCP）和用戶數據報協議（UDP），以及它們相關的端口和協議。我們將專門解決當今使用的各種電子郵件端口和協議，並在Web安全的背景下討論安全套接字層/傳輸層安全性（SSL / TLS）。然後，我們將討論文件傳輸協議（FTP）和超文本傳輸協議（HTTP）及其在當今Internet上的使用，以及一些較老的技術，例如Telnet及其更安全的替代方法，安全外殼（SSH）。 \n TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures the reliable transport of data segments from one device to another. During transmission, if a segment is dropped, it will be detected and resent or retransmitted by the originator device. Each communication is acknowledged upon receipt, providing a secure model to ensure successful communications. This type of transmission is great for all network data types, especially those that need delivery to be assured. \n When a TCP communication is initiated, the originator and receiver perform a “three-way handshake” before starting the data transmission. In the first step, the originator sends a packet with a synchronization (SYN) flag set. Next, the receiver acknowledges receipt of this SYN flagged packet by sending back a synchronization-acknowledged (SYN-ACK) flagged packet. Finally, the originator sends an acknowledgement of the synchronization-acknowledged flagged packet, and then data transmission occurs. \n TCP是一種面向連接的協議，可確保將數據段從一台設備可靠地傳輸到另一台設備。在傳輸過程中，如果某個段丟失，則發起方設備將檢測到該段並將其重新發送或重新傳輸。每次通信在收到後都會得到確認，從而提供一個安全的模型來確保成功進行通信。這種傳輸方式適用於所有網絡數據類型，尤其是那些需要確保傳輸的網絡數據類型。 \n 當啟動TCP通信時，發起方和接收方在開始數據傳輸之前執行“三向握手”。第一步，發起方發送一個設置了同步（SYN）標誌的數據包。接下來，接收器通過發回一個同步確認（SYN-ACK）標記數據包來確認此SYN標記數據包的接收。最後，始發者發送對已同步確認的標記數據包的確認，然後發生數據傳輸。 \n TCP Vs. UDP\xa0 TCPVs。UDP協議 \n TCP and UDP have many differences. TCP is reliable, but UDP is unreliable. TCP focuses on connection-oriented communications using the three-way handshake, while UDP is connectionless. TCP uses windowing, discussed in more detail later, to control the amount of data sent at a given time based on changing network speeds, but UDP simply transmits everything once with no windowing. TCP also supports segment sequencing; UDP just hopes it gets to the destination in the right order. Finally, TCP waits for acknowledgements, but UDP just hopes it got there. To simplify it, TCP is an assured and reliable communication method, UDP is just a best-effort model. \n learn by doing \n TCP和UDP有許多區別。TCP是可靠的，但UDP是不可靠的。TCP專注於使用三向握手的面向連接的通信，而UDP是無連接的。TCP使用開窗（稍後將詳細討論）來基於不斷變化的網絡速度來控制在給定時間發送的數據量，但是UDP僅傳輸所有信息一次而沒有開窗。TCP還支持段排序；UDP只是希望它以正確的順序到達目的地。最後，TCP等待確認，但是UDP只是希望它到達目的地。為簡化起見，TCP是一種有保證且可靠的通信方法，UDP只是一種盡力而為的模型。 \n TCP Windowing\xa0 \xa0TCP窗口 \n TCP also supports a concept called windowing. If you have ever copied a file from a network share drive on the Windows operating system, you have seen windowing. Have you ever noticed when you copy a file over the network, it may start out saying there are “2 minutes remaining” until completion, then it jumps up to “3 hours remaining,” then back down to “30 minutes remaining”? This is TCP windowing in action. \n Essentially, when a communication session is established with TCP, it first performs the three-way handshake. Next, it starts with a small window size, like windows size 1 in the image below, where a single segment is sent over the network and acknowledged. If this is successful, it increases the window size to 2, sending two segments at a time. It continues to do this, increasing the number of segments each time, transmitting more data in each window until an error occurs and retransmissions must be done. If errors occur, TCP understands that it must have been transmitting too fast, so it shrinks the window to slow down communication. As transmissions occur successfully, it again increases the window to push more data in each window. This window size is continually adjusted to get the most segments per window with the least errors in communication. \n TCP還支持稱為窗口化的概念。如果您曾經從Windows操作系統上的網絡共享驅動器中復製過文件，則會看到窗口。您是否曾經註意到通過網絡複製文件時，它可能會說“剩餘2分鐘”直到完成，然後跳到“剩餘3小時”，然後又跳回到“剩餘30分鐘”？這是TCP窗口在起作用。 \n 本質上，當使用TCP建立通信會話時，它首先執行三向握手。接下來，它以較小的窗口大小開始，如下面的圖片中的窗口大小1所示，其中單個段通過網絡發送並確認。如果成功，它將窗口大小增加到2，一次發送兩個段。它繼續執行此操作，每次增加段數，在每個窗口中傳輸更多數據，直到發生錯誤並必須重新傳輸為止。如果發生錯誤，TCP知道它一定傳輸速度太快，因此它縮小了窗口以減慢通信速度。隨著傳輸成功進行，它將再次增加窗口以在每個窗口中推送更多數據。 \n Each client and server has an IP address. Clients and servers are identified on the network by their IP addresses. In addition to an IP address, each machine has numerous “ports” that we can utilize. A port is an endpoint to a logical connection. A client program specifies a particular server program on a computer in a network by identifying a port. Ports allow a single client to communicate simultaneously with multiple other devices, separating each session by using a designated port number. \n 每個客戶端和服務器都有一個IP地址。客戶端和服務器通過其IP地址在網絡上進行標識。除了IP地址外，每台機器都有許多我們可以利用的“端口”。端口是邏輯連接的端點。客戶端程序通過識別端口來指定網絡中計算機上的特定服務器程序。端口允許單個客戶端與多個其他設備同時通信，並使用指定的端口號分隔每個會話。 \n Email\xa0 \xa0電子郵件 \n Email has evolved a lot over the years, but still operates on three main protocols. Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard for sending email and most outbound email is sent using SMTP. SMTP uses port 25 to send email from network devices. \n POP3 is the most common account type for personal email, but messages are typically deleted from the server when you check your email. \n Internet message access protocol (IMAP) servers let you work with email messages without downloading them to your computer first. This allows for email to be synchronized (synced) across multiple devices, including your desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone. IMAP uses port 143 to receive and synchronize your email. The real benefit of using IMAP, especially in today’s multiple device access world, is that it can change the read and delete state of messages across the multiple devices. For example, if I read a message on my phone, when I log into my desktop, the message will also show as having been read already. \n 多年來，電子郵件已經有了很大的發展，但仍在三種主要協議上運行。簡單郵件傳輸協議（SMTP）是用於發送電子郵件的Internet標準，大多數出站電子郵件都是使用SMTP發送的。SMTP使用端口25從網絡設備發送電子郵件。 \n POP3是最常見的個人電子郵件帳戶類型，但是當您檢查電子郵件時，通常會將郵件從服務器中刪除。 \n Internet郵件訪問協議（IMAP）服務器使您可以處理電子郵件，而無需先將其下載到計算機上。這允許跨多個設備（包括台式機，筆記本電腦，平板電腦和智能手機）同步電子郵件。IMAP使用端口143接收和同步您的電子郵件。使用IMAP的真正好處（尤其是在當今的多設備訪問世界中）是，它可以更改跨多個設備的消息的讀取和刪除狀態。例如，如果我在手機上閱讀了一條消息，則當我登錄到桌面時，該消息也將顯示為已被閱讀。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923243 UNIT 4\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 97~108.html'}, {'title': '40923252 UNIT 4\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Page 109~120', 'text': 'PCH14-TCP and UDP Protocols \n learning objective-學習目標 \n 1.

FTP concerns itself with data only and as such eliminates the overhead of extraneous information such as what HTTP allows in addition to the actual data (advertisements, banners, images, etc.). This alleviates processing and bandwidth overhead and allows the client to simply retrieve the data from the server. \n 在OSI（開放系統互連）模型中，應用程序層使用諸如簡單文件傳輸協議（TFTP），文件傳輸協議（FTP）和安全文件傳輸協議（使用TLS / SSL的FTPS）之類的協議來允許用戶遷移數據在客戶端-服務器模型中。 FTP僅關注數據本身，因此消除了額外信息的開銷 ，例如除了實際數據（廣告，橫幅，圖像等）之外，HTTP允許的信息。這減輕了處理和帶寬開銷，並使客戶端可以簡單地從服務器檢索數據。 \n FTP services can be accessed using client software such as ftp.exe (provided in all Microsoft operating systems), third-party software such as Filezilla or WinSCP, and any modern/current browser. Most light-duty users outside a corporate environment will not use a client FTP (or its secure version) because web browsers can negotiate FTP as well as HTTP. Public FTP servers allow for an anonymous user name so the client can reach file directories specifically designed for public access. \n 可以使用諸如ftp.exe（在所有Microsoft操作系統中提供）之類的客戶端軟件，諸如Filezilla或WinSCP之類的第三方軟件以及任何現代/最新的瀏覽器來訪問FTP服務。公司環境之外的大多數輕型用戶都不會使用客戶端FTP（或其安全版本），因為 Web瀏覽器可以協商FTP以及HTTP 。公用FTP服務器允許使用匿名用戶名，以便客戶端可以訪問專門為公用訪問設計的文件目錄。 \n These network communications are passed through the presentation layer to the session layer, where sockets and sessions are created using logical port numbers as defined by TCP or UDP. TCP is stateful, connection-oriented and reliable. UDP is stateless, connectionless, and less reliable. The combination of source and destination address coupled with the logical port number creates a network socket, which establishes the session for process-to-process communication.\xa0The material in this section is used under CC-BY license from\xa0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer. \n 這些網絡通信通過表示層傳遞到會話層，在會話層中，使用由TCP或UDP定義的邏輯端口號創建套接字和會話。 \xa0 TCP是有狀態的，面向連接的且可靠的 。 \xa0 UDP是無狀態，無連接且可靠性較低的 。源地址和目標地址以及邏輯端口號的組合創建了一個網絡套接字，該網絡套接字建立了進程間通信的會話。 本節中的材料根據https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer的CC-BY許可使用。 \n Active vs. Passive \n Active FTP is a point-to-point connection that the client initiates and connects to the FTP server port 21 for commands and port 20 for data. That means that the server will actively initiate the connections back to the client’s listening port and will require the client to allow these connections, which the firewall blocks by default. Passive FTP allows the client to initiate the data connection on port 21, and then the FTP server moves the command and data connections to random ports on the server (with numbers higher than 1023). By initiating the connection from the client side, the burden of allowing a pass-through on the firewall resides with the FTP server administrator, who is better equipped to set a range of ports allowing connectivity. \n 主動FTP是點對點連接 ，客戶端啟動該點並連接到FTP服務器端口21（用於命令）和端口20（用於數據）。這意味著服務器將主動啟動與客戶端偵聽端口的連接，並要求客戶端允許這些連接，防火牆默認情況下會阻止這些連接。被動FTP允許客戶端在端口21上啟動數據連接，然後FTP服務器將命令和數據連接移至服務器上的隨機端口（數字大於1023）。通過從客戶端發起連接，允許通過防火牆的負擔由FTP服務器管理員承擔，他可以更好地設置一系列允許連接的端口。 \n Using FTP \n Accessing FTP public servers using the command line is not nearly as user-friendly as using a web browser. However, both methods are viable and in use in corporate networks. \n 使用命令行訪問FTP公共服務器並不像使用Web瀏覽器那樣友好。但是，這兩種方法都是可行的，並且已在公司網絡中使用。 \n \n Open a web browser of choice （打開選擇的網絡瀏覽器） \n Use this URL: ftp.funet.fi （使用此URL：ftp.funet.fi\xa0 URL:統一資源定位符 ） \n Click “pubs,” then “standards,” then “RFC” （點擊“發布”，然後點擊“標準”，然後點擊“ RFC”\xa0 RFC:請求意見稿 ） \n Search RFC 959 and access either the .txt or .pdf file (left-click) （搜索RFC 959並訪問.txt或.pdf文件） \n Search RFC 4217 and access either the .txt or .pdf file (left-click) （搜索RFC 4217並訪問.txt或.pdf文件） \n If you actually needed the file you can right-click and save as. （如果您確實需要該文件，則可以右鍵單擊並另存。） \n \n Now that you see the file structure, notice it is similar to navigating a local hard drive with the only difference being that you use the “/” (forward slash) instead of the “\\” (backslash) because you are accessing the folders through the Internet. \n 現在您已經看到文件結構，請注意，它類似於瀏覽本地硬盤驅動器， 唯一的區別是您使用“ /”（正斜杠）而不是“ \\”（反斜杠） ，因為您通過以下方式訪問文件夾互聯網。 \n Note: In this next step using the command-line interface, you will only be able to navigate the FTP server, and will not be able to transfer files, because ftp.exe does not support passive mode by default. You can use a command-line tool in a Linux Distro; or, in Windows, you can go to Passive-FTP.com and download the freeware. \n 注意：在接下來的使用命令行界面的步驟中，您將只能瀏覽FTP服務器，並且將無法傳輸文件， 因為ftp.exe默認情況下不支持被動模式 。您可以在Linux Distro中使用命令行工具。或者，在Windows中，您可以轉到Passive-FTP.com並下載免費軟件。 \n However, you can create a workaround by first allowing FTP through your firewall (be sure to put firewall restrictions back in place after the exercise), and then issuing the following commands after you enter the password: \n 但是，您可以通過首先允許FTP通過防火牆（確保在練習後將防火牆限制放回原位），然後在輸入密碼後發出以下命令來創建解決方法： \n \n quote pasv \xa0 引用pasv(pasv-FTP的被動模式) \n \n \n \n Now the “dir, ls” (list directory contents), and “get” (download) commands will work. \n By default, the file will download to your user root at C:\\Windows\\Users\\** your user name ** or at the root of C:\\ (wherever your OS is installed). \n \n \n 現在，“ dir，ls”（列出目錄內容）和“ get”（下載）命令將起作用。 \n 默認情況下，該文件將下載到您的用戶根目錄，即C:\\Windows\\Users\\**您的用戶名**或C:\\的根目錄(無論尼按裝了OS的位置)。 \n \n As a public FTP server set to passive mode, certain commands do not work and invoke the server to close the socket. If that happens, re-do your log on. \n 將公共FTP服務器設置為被動模式後，某些命令將不起作用 ，並調用服務器以關閉網路插座。如果發生這種情況，請重新登錄。 \n Use the keyboard command \xa0 \xa0 + r and type ftp (from an administrative command line interface you can also type ftp). The prompt changes to ftp> \n 使用鍵盤命令 + r並輸入ftp（在管理命令行界面中，您也可以輸入ftp）。提示符更改為ftp> \n \n \n Type “help” and look at the commands. （輸入“ help”並查看命令） \n Type at the command prompt: open ftp.funet.fi. （在命令提示符下鍵入：打開ftp.funet.fi） \n Follow the prompts to log on. （按照提示進行登錄） \n Username: anonymous. （用戶名：匿名） \n Password: any generic e-mail (such as user@user.com ) . （密碼：任何通用電子郵件） \n \n You get a welcome message and can now navigate through the directory structure you saw in the browser by typing the following commands: \n 您會收到一條歡迎消息，現在可以通過輸入以下命令來瀏覽瀏覽器中看到的目錄結構： \n \n pwd — lists the current directory. （ pwd-列出當前目錄。） \n \n \n \n cd — changes the directory. This may be in the form of: （ cd —更改目錄。可以採用以下形式：） \n \n \n cd pub (refer to the URL path from the previous exercise), or （cd pub（請參閱上一練習中的URL路徑），或） \n cd/pub/standards/RFC/ \n \n \n Now if you are using the workaround, Mac, or Linux you can download a file using the “get” command: \n 現在，如果您使用的是變通方法，Mac或Linux，則可以使用“ get”命令下載文件： \n \n Without the passive mode workaround, a third-party FTP client, Mac, or Linux this is as far as you can go. However, in the corporate environment you might be required to troubleshoot FTP on the local intranet, which would most likely be set to active FTP. Clearly, the need for command-line FTP service is fairly limited compared to using a browser. \n 如果沒有被動模式解決方法，則只能使用第三方FTP客戶端 ，Mac或Linux。但是，在公司環境中，可能需要對本地Intranet上的FTP進行故障排除，這很可能會設置為活動FTP。顯然，與使用瀏覽器相比，命令行FTP服務的需求非常有限。 \n SSL \n learning objective-學習目標 \n Identify SSL in use. （識別正在使用的SSL） \n Secure sockets layer (SSL) is a cryptographic protocol designed to secure network communications at the application layer. Netscape developed the original protocol in 1995 and SSL became deprecated and was replaced by transport layer security (TLS) in 2015. For more information about SSL, visit this\xa0 website . \n 安全套接字層（SSL）是一種加密協議 ，旨在保護應用程序層的網絡通信安全。 Netscape在1995年開發了原始協議，並且不贊成使用SSL，並在2015年由傳輸層安全性（TLS）代替。有關SSL的更多信息，請訪問此網站。 \n The most common place to see TLS/SSL in action is in your web browser. For example, most all web sites now default from http (port 80) to https (port 443) with TLS. It is a client-server model where the client initiates the request to connect and the server offers the secure protocol. \n 實際使用TLS / SSL的最常見地方是您的Web瀏覽器。例如，大多數網站現在默認使用TLS從http（端口80）更改為https（端口443）。這是一種客戶端-服務器模型，其中客戶端發起連接請求，服務器提供安全協議。 \n Example \n Try this: （嘗試這個） \n \n Type: http://facebook.com or http://google.com into the browser of your choice. Notice the new URL changed to https. （在您選擇的瀏覽器中輸入：http://facebook.com或http://google.com。 請注意，新URL更改為https 。） \n \n \n Next, click on the padlock → connection. If you have an antivirus plug-in you might see the company’s certificate instead in browsers such as Internet Explorer. （接下來，單擊掛鎖→連接。 如果您具有防病毒插件，則可能會在Internet Explorer之類的瀏覽器中看到該公司的證書 。） \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH14-TCP and UDP Protocols.html'}, {'title': 'PCH15-Introduction to Wireless Networking', 'text': '\n Wireless LANs \n Overview \n The popularity of wireless local area networks (WLAN) has increased exponentially because WLAN enables people to remain connected to the network and the Internet without being tethered by wires. In this unit, we are going to cover the concepts, components, standards, design considerations, and security of WLANs. IEEE 802.11 is the overarching standard for wireless LAN technology, and was developed and is maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to provide wireless Ethernet connectivity to a wired IEEE 802.3 network. \n 無線局域網（WLAN）的普及已成倍增加， 因為WLAN使人們能夠保持連接到網絡和Internet，而不必受到電線的束縛 。在本單元中，我們將介紹WLAN的概念，組件，標準，設計注意事項和安全性。 \xa0 IEEE 802.11是無線LAN技術的總體標準 ，由電氣和電子工程師協會（IEEE）開發和維護，以提供與有線IEEE 802.3網絡的無線以太網連接。 \n WLAN Concepts \n Wireless local area networks are broken down into two generalized categories: ad-hoc WLANs and infrastructure WLANs. In ad hoc wireless networks, the wireless devices communicate directly with each other without the need for a wireless access point. This mode is similar to a peer-to-peer network topology, where each device connects to each other device in a mesh configuration using radio frequency waves directly between each wireless device’s interface card. This is the wireless equivalent of connecting two workstations together using a crossover cable, thereby eliminating the need for network infrastructure like hubs and switches. \n 無線局域網分為兩大類：臨時WLAN和基礎設施WLAN。在無線隨意網絡中，無線設備之間可以直接相互通信，而無需無線接入點。此模式類似於點對點網絡布局，在這種布局中，每個設備都使用網狀配置，直接在每個無線設備的接口卡之間使用射頻波連接到彼此。這相當於使用交叉電纜將兩個工作站連接在一起的無線方式，從而消除了對集線器和交換機等網絡基礎設施的需求。 \n The second category, infrastructure WLANs, is the version that is most often and widely utilized. When operating in infrastructure mode, the wireless devices communicate to a centralized wireless router or wireless access point, and then use that centralized device to initiate communication with other wireless or wired devices that are also attached to the centralized device. This is the wireless equivalent of connecting multiple workstations to a common hub or switch and utilizing that network device to create communication between the workstations. \n 第二類是基礎設施WLAN，是最常用和廣泛使用的版本。當在基礎結構模式下運行時，無線設備與集中式無線路由器或無線接入點進行通信，然後使用該集中式設備啟動與也連接到該集中式設備的其他無線或有線設備的通信。這相當於將多個工作站連接到公共集線器或交換機，並利用該網絡設備在工作站之間創建通信。 \n Wireless Devices \n learning objective-學習目標 \n Configure a wireless connection.（配置無線連接） \n As previously stated, most wireless networks utilize infrastructure mode and make use of a wireless router or wireless access point to connect the multitude of wireless devices in a given network. A wireless router is used in most small office/home office (SOHO) networks. These devices combine a router, a switch, and a wireless access point and serve as a base station and gateway for the wireless devices. The wireless router allows the wireless devices to communicate with each other using its wireless access point and switch functionality, and then uses its router functionality to connect devices to the remote network: in most cases, the Internet. The wireless router often combines multiple devices into a single, small device. These features include a wireless access point (WAP), a switch, a router, a firewall, and a modem (either cable, fiber, or DSL depending on the Internet service provider). \n 如前所述， 大多數無線網絡都利用基礎架構模式，並利用無線路由器或無線接入點來連接給定網絡中的眾多無線設備 。在大多數小型辦公室/家庭辦公室（SOHO）網絡中使用無線路由器。這些設備將路由器，交換機和無線接入點結合在一起，並充當無線設備的基站和網關。 無線路由器允許無線設備使用其無線接入點和交換機功能相互通信 ，然後使用其路由器功能將設備連接到遠程網絡：在大多數情況下為Internet。 無線路由器通常將多個設備組合為一個小型設備 。這些功能包括無線訪問點（WAP），交換機，路由器，防火牆和調製解調器（電纜，光纖或DSL，取決於Internet服務提供商）。 \n Wireless access points, which are integrated into SOHO wireless routers, can also be purchased as standalone units. These are most often seen in corporate environments as part of an enterprise network. A wireless access point enables a wired LAN to communicate with a wireless LAN. The standalone WAP does not interconnect the two networks, though, since it is not a router. A WAP is simply a physical device that converts the radio frequency into 1s and 0s that are easily understood by the physical switch. Note that all wireless devices and the devices on the wired LAN are seen as a single subnet in a standard network. A WAP operates like a hub, broadcasting all the information it receives over the radio frequency waves and relying on the connected devices to only listen to their own traffic. \n 集成到SOHO無線路由器中的無線訪問點也可以作為獨立單元購買。這些通常在公司環境中被視為企業網絡的一部分。無線訪問點使有線局域網能夠與無線局域網進行通信。但是， 獨立的WAP無法將兩個網絡互連，因為它不是路由器 。 WAP只是一種將無線電頻率轉換為1和0的物理設備，物理交換機很容易理解。請注意，所有無線設備和有線LAN上的設備在標準網絡中都被視為單個子網。 WAP就像集線器一樣工作，它會通過射頻波廣播接收到的所有信息，並依靠連接的設備僅監聽其自身的流量。 \n \n Wireless network interface cards (NICs) for WiFi, Bluetooth, and infrared are generally integrated into motherboard circuitry. If your computer doesn’t have one built in, you have the ability to add one either using an external USB wireless network adapter, or installing one in a PCIe expansion slot; just remember to install the appropriate drivers for your operating system to enable proper operations. \n 用於WiFi，藍牙和紅外的無線網絡接口卡（NIC）通常集成在主板電路中。如果您的計算機沒有內置計算機，則可以使用外部USB無線網絡適配器添加計算機，也可以在PCIe擴展插槽中安裝計算機。 只需記住為您的操作系統安裝適當的驅動程序即可啟用正確的操作 。 \n Wireless Standards \n learning objective-學習目標 \n Compare wireless network standards, encryption, and interfaces.（比較無線網絡標準，加密和接口） \n Background and History \n Wireless (Wi-Fi) networking speeds, the technology behind broadcast streams, and wireless security have greatly improved user connectivity, which in turn has increased the use of multi-purpose devices such as smartphones and tablets in corporate and SOHO networks. The freedom of Wi-Fi has become the infrastructure of choice and essentially relegated wired networks more to moving mass data traffic and less user traffic. Although it will not eliminate the wired infrastructure, because Wi-Fi access points need to connect to a wired device using the Ethernet standard, Wi-Fi allows greater expandability and access for IT departments in both corporate and SOHO environments. \n 無線（Wi-Fi）網絡速度，廣播流背後的技術以及無線安全性極大地改善了用戶連接性，進而增加了企業和SOHO網絡中諸如智能手機和平板電腦等多功能設備的使用。 Wi-Fi的自由度已成為首選的基礎架構，從本質上講，降低了有線網絡的傳輸效率，使之可以移動海量數據流量而減少用戶流量。儘管不會消除有線基礎架構，但 由於Wi-Fi接入點需要使用以太網標準連接到有線設備，因此Wi-Fi允許企業和SOHO環境中的IT部門具有更大的可擴展性和訪問權限 。 \n At the time when Wi-Fi became viable for implementation, the wired standard available in most corporate and SOHO networks operated at 100 Mbps. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards Committee creates and maintains media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for implementing WLAN computer communication. The IEEE 802.11 standard is overarching guidance that has been provided for the large number of wireless standards. The IEEE Wi-Fi standard is 802.11 with a small letter designation referring to the next revision (e.g., 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ad, etc.). Each standard (like 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n) is differentiated by the frequency range or frequency band that it utilizes. \n 當Wi-Fi成為可行的實現時，大多數公司和SOHO網絡中可用的有線標準以100 Mbps的速度運行。 電氣和電子工程師協會（IEEE）標準委員會創建並維護用於實現WLAN計算機通信的媒體訪問控制（MAC）和物理層（PHY）規範 。 IEEE 802.11標準是為大量無線標準提供的總體指導。 IEEE Wi-Fi標準是802.11，帶有小寫字母，表示下一個修訂版本（例如802.11n，802.11ac，802.11ad等）。每個標準（如802.11a，802.11b，802.11g或802.11n）都根據其使用的頻率範圍或頻帶進行區分。 \n The 802.11 standard was initially ratified in 1997 and devices compliant with the 802.11a and 802.11b revisions became commercially available soon after in 2000. Despite higher throughput, 802.11a devices were not as readily adopted as 802.11b devices. At the time Wi-Fi became viable to deploy 802.11b at a maximum throughput of 11 Mbps, wired networks were at a minimum of 100 Mbps in most corporate and SOHO environments. The slower throughput kept users more reliant on traditional desktop machines and less likely to use their new wireless-capable laptops wirelessly. Once 802.11g was sufficiently saturated in the market, the disparity between its 54 Mbps speed and the 100 Mbps speed of wired networks became less noticeable and consumers became more interested in being wireless. The industry continued to push for ways to design higher throughput devices and incorporate the hardware into mobile devices such as cell phones, tablets, and lighter-weight laptops. \n 802.11標準最初是在1997年批准的，並且與802.11a和802.11b修訂版兼容的設備在2000年之後不久就可以商業化使用。儘管吞吐量更高，但802.11a設備卻不如802.11b設備那樣容易採用。當Wi-Fi能夠以11 Mbps的最大吞吐量部署802.11b時， 在大多數公司和SOHO環境中，有線網絡的最低速度為100 Mbps 。較低的吞吐量使用戶更依賴於傳統台式機，並且不太可能無線使用其具有無線功能的新型筆記本電腦。一旦802.11g在市場上充分飽和，其54 Mbps速度與100 Mbps有線網絡速度之間的差異就變得不那麼明顯了，消費者對無線變得越來越感興趣。業界一直在尋求方法來設計更高吞吐量的設備，並將硬件整合到移動設備中，例如手機，平板電腦和更輕便的筆記本電腦。 \n Wireless LANs use two primary frequency bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The 2.4 GHz range actually encompasses 2.4 to 2.5 GHz frequencies, while the 5 GHz range is 5.75 GHz to 5.875 GHz. Each frequency band has specific channels (or small portions of frequency) at which the devices operate to avoid overlapping with other wireless LAN devices. For 2.4 GHz frequency bands, it is important to choose channels 1, 6, and 11 to avoid overlapping frequencies. This is because overlapping can cause interference in your networks and cause data transmission and receiving issues for the devices. \n 無線局域網使用兩個主要頻段：2.4 GHz和5 GHz 。 2.4 GHz範圍實際上包含2.4至2.5 GHz頻率，而5 GHz範圍是5.75 GHz至5.875 GHz。 每個頻帶具有設備在其上操作的特定信道（或頻率的一小部分），以避免與其他無線LAN設備重疊 。對於2.4 GHz頻帶，重要的是選擇信道1、6和11，以避免頻率重疊。這是因為重疊會導致網絡干擾，並導致設備的數據傳輸和接收問題。 \n Speed,Range,and Frequencies \n Bandwidth speed has been greatly improved through the revisions after 802.11b, as shown in the table below. When discussing data flow and speed, the two terms referred to are bandwidth and throughput. Though they are often used interchangeably, the two terms are different and need to be understood. Simply put, bandwidth is the theoretical maximum of the given standard, whereas throughput is the actual potential in a real-world scenario. Many factors affect actual throughput, such as frequency, channel overlap, and broadcast streams. \n 如下表所示，通過802.11b的修訂，帶寬速度得到了極大的提高。在 討論數據流和速度時，所指的兩個術語是帶寬和吞吐量 。儘管它們經常互換使用，但這兩個術語是不同的，需要理解。簡而言之， 帶寬是給定標準的理論最大值，而吞吐量是實際情況下的實際潛力 。許多因素都會影響實際的吞吐量，例如頻率，頻道重疊和廣播流。 \n \n The four wireless standards that are important to focus your studies on are 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n. 802.11a operates in the 5 GHz frequency band, has a maximum bandwidth of 54 Mbps, and has a range of up to 35 meters indoors and 120 meters outdoors. 802.11b operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, has a maximum bandwidth of 11 Mbps, and has a range of up to 32 meters indoors and 140 meters outdoors. 802.11g operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, has a maximum bandwidth of 54 Mbps, and has a range of up to 32 meters indoors and 140 meters outdoors. 802.11n features a dual-band transceiver, operating in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, has a maximum bandwidth of more than 300 Mbps, and has a range of up to 70 meters indoors and 250 meters outdoors. \n 專注於研究的四個無線標準是802.11a，802.11b，802.11g和802.11n。 802.11a工作在5 GHz頻段，最大帶寬為54 Mbps，室內的最大距離為35米，室外的最大距離為120米。 802.11b工作在2.4 GHz頻段，最大帶寬為11 Mbps，室內最大範圍為32米，室外最大範圍為140米。 802.11g工作在2.4 GHz頻段，最大帶寬為54 Mbps，室內最大範圍為32米，室外最大範圍為140米。 802.11n具有工作在2.4 GHz和5 GHz頻帶上的雙頻收發器，最大帶寬超過300 Mbps，室內最大範圍為70米，室外最大範圍為250米。 \n The 2.4 GHz frequency band is more robust than the 5.0 GHz in that it is less susceptible to interference and has a wider distance range. However, many more devices such as RC toys, cordless telephones, other radio devices such as mice and keyboards, and microwave ovens also operate in the 2.4 GHz frequency, so it is more crowded, which can have a negative impact on throughput. Although the 5.0 GHz frequency band is less crowded, it is more susceptible to obstructions such as building infrastructure (i.e., walls, floors, steel beams, etc.) due to absorption. \n 2.4 GHz頻段比5.0 GHz更加健壯，因為它不易受到干擾，並且距離範圍更廣 。但是，更多的設備（例如RC玩具，無繩電話，其他無線電設備（例如，鼠標和鍵盤）和微波爐）也以2.4 GHz頻率運行，因此擁擠不堪，這可能會對吞吐量產生負面影響。儘管 5.0 GHz頻帶的擁擠程度較小，但由於吸收，它更容易受到諸如建築基礎設施（即牆壁，地板，鋼樑等）的障礙物的影響 。 \n Beginning with the 802.11n standard and subsequently moving to the current 802.11ac standard, manufacturers incorporated multiple antennae to achieve higher throughput. Known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), both revisions accomplish the higher throughput by allowing operation at two different channel widths (20 and 40 MHz) within the same frequency and operate on both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequency bands at the same time. Wireless N (802.11n) and wireless AC have a much larger bandwidth and maximum range, because they use MIMO and multiple frequency bands working in tandem to increase transmission and reception. \n 從802.11n標准開始，然後發展到當前的802.11ac標準，製造商採用了多個天線來實現更高的吞吐量。這兩種版本都稱為多輸入多輸出（MIMO），通過允許在同一頻率內在兩個不同的信道寬度（20和40 MHz）下運行，並在2.4 GHz和5.0 GHz頻段上同時運行，從而實現了更高的吞吐量。時間。無線N（802.11n）和無線AC具有更大的帶寬和最大範圍，因為它們使用MIMO和多個頻段協同工作以增加傳輸和接收。 \n An important note is that wireless N, G, and B are all compatible because they all support the 2.4 GHz frequency, allowing for backward compatibility. If you use multiple standards, like B, G, and N devices at the same time on a singular wireless N wireless access point, the WAP will default back to wireless B standards to support each device, which will significantly slow down the network. Wireless N and wireless A are compatible because they both use the 5 GHz frequency band. However, wireless A is \xa0 not \xa0 compatible with wireless B or G devices. \n 重要說明是，無線N，G和B都兼容，因為它們都支持2.4 GHz頻率 ，因此可以向後兼容。如果您在單個無線N無線接入點上同時使用多個標準，例如B，G和N設備，則WAP將默認恢復為無線B標準以支持每個設備，這將大大降低網絡速度。無線N和無線A兼容，因為它們都使用5 GHz頻帶。但是，無線A與無線B或G設備不兼容。 \n Sources of Interference \n Wireless networks are subject to radio frequency interference (RFI) because of other devices using frequencies in the same band as the WLAN devices. There are many sources of interference in the 2.4 GHz range, which is one reason that wireless N and newer networks have switched to the 5 GHz frequency band. The frequency interference can be caused by other WLAN devices, such as having numerous WLANs in a single building and each WAP using the same channel or channels close in number (like channel 1 and 2, or 1 and 3). To prevent this, 2.4 GHz standard wireless devices should operate in channels separated by multiple channels, such as using channels 1, 6, and 11. \n 由於其他設備使用與WLAN設備相同頻帶的頻率，因此無線網絡會受到射頻干擾（RFI）。在2.4 GHz範圍內有許多干擾源，這是無線N和較新網絡已切換到5 GHz頻帶的原因之一。頻率干擾可能是由其他WLAN設備引起的，例如，在一棟建築物中有多個WLAN，並且每個WAP使用使用數量相同的一個或多個接近的通道（例如通道1和2，或通道1和3）。為避免這種情況，2.4 GHz標準無線設備應在由多個通道分隔的通道中運行，例如使用通道1、6和11。 \n Cordless phones, baby monitors, microwave ovens, wireless security systems, and other cordless electronics generally use the 2.4 GHz range, as well, so if you have many of those devices near your network, you may wish to upgrade to wireless N (5 GHz) to avoid interference. Physical obstacles, such as walls, appliances, cabinets, and other dense objects can also block the radio wave propagation, causing weak signals and network interference. Finally, the cause of interference could be that the originating signal is too weak, and some wireless access points allow you to increase the transmission power to overcome this type of interference. \n 無繩電話，嬰兒監視器，微波爐，無線安全系統和其他無繩電子設備通常也使用2.4 GHz範圍，因此，如果網絡中有許多此類設備，則可能希望升級到無線N（5 GHz ），以避免干擾。牆壁，電器，櫥櫃和其他密集物體等物理障礙物也會阻擋無線電波的傳播，從而導致信號微弱和網絡干擾。最後，造成乾擾的原因可能是始發信號太弱，某些無線接入點使您可以增加傳輸功率以克服這種類型的干擾。 \n Privacy and Security \n learning objective-學習目標 \n Identify major wireless security measures. （確定主要的無線安全措施） \n Due to the nature of Wi-Fi being transmitted through radio frequencies, the data transferred is susceptible to being viewed and captured by any other radio receiver. Encryption and network security have become a paramount concern for IT professionals at all levels. If a Wi-Fi network is set up without encryption it is “open,” and anybody with packet sniffing software in the vicinity can capture the transmissions between the host and the wireless access point. Public cafes and retailers offering open access do so as a courtesy, but the user must know that any online login information, such as connecting to a bank, Facebook, or Twitter, is not secure and is susceptible to capture. For the prospective technician, you must know the current encryption types and best practices to secure a WLAN. \n 由於Wi-Fi會通過射頻傳輸，因此傳輸的數據很容易被其他任何無線電接收器查看和捕獲 。加密和網絡安全已成為各級IT專業人員最關心的問題。如果建立了未加密的Wi-Fi網絡，則它是“開放的”，附近裝有數據包嗅探軟件的任何人都可以捕獲主機與無線訪問點之間的傳輸。提供開放訪問權限的公共咖啡館和零售商這樣做是出於禮貌，但是用戶必須知道任何在線登錄信息（例如連接到銀行，Facebook或Twitter）都不安全並且容易被捕獲。對於準技術人員，您必須了解當前的加密類型和最佳做法以保護WLAN。 \n Encryption Types \n In order to provide security for wireless networks, the 802.11 standards provide for three major types of password protection/encryption: wired equivalent privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi protected access (WPA), and Wi-Fi protected access 2 (WPA2). \n 為了提供無線網絡的安全性，802.11標準提供了三種主要的密碼保護/加密類型： 有線等效保密（WEP），Wi-Fi保護訪問（WPA）和Wi-Fi保護訪問2（WPA2） 。 \n Wired Equivalent Privacy(WEP) \n In the original 802.11 standard, the only security provided was WEP, which claims to be as secure as a wired network connection. This wireless connection was secured using encryption with a 40-bit WEP key that all access points and client devices would use (preshared key). This symmetric encryption was a good idea, but since the key was so small (40 bits), it was quickly broken by attackers. \n 在原始802.11標準中，唯一提供的安全性是WEP，它聲稱與有線網絡連接一樣安全。通過使用所有訪問點和客戶端設備都將使用的40位WEP密鑰（預共享密鑰）進行加密來保護此無線連接。這種對稱加密是一個好主意，但是由於密鑰很小（40位），因此攻擊者很快就將其破壞了。 \n To solve this, WEP evolved into using a 64-bit key and could support keys up to 128 bits, which would provide strong encryption. Unfortunately, the WEP algorithm used for encryption also relied on using an initialization vector (IV) in combination with the preshared key to create the strong encryption, but the IV was only created at 24 bits and is sent in plain text or clear text during the preshared key exchange. This was quickly compromised by attackers using a brute-force attack to determine the password using the weak IV. Many utilities exist in the open-source realm that can crack WEP passwords within just a few minutes on modern hardware. For this reason, WEP is considered insecure today and should never be used in your networks. \n 為了解決這個問題，WEP演變為使用64位密鑰，並且可以支持高達128位的密鑰，從而可以提供強大的加密功能。不幸的是，用於加密的WEP算法還依賴於使用初始化向量（IV）結合預共享密鑰來創建強加密，但是IV僅以24位創建，並且在加密期間以純文本或明文發送。預共享密鑰交換。攻擊者使用強力攻擊使用弱IV來確定密碼，從而很快破壞了這一安全性。開源領域中存在許多實用程序，可以在短短幾分鐘內在現代硬件上破解WEP密碼。因此，WEP在今天被認為是不安全的，永遠不要在您的網絡中使用。 \n Wi-Fi Protected Access(WPA) \n The WPA standard was introduced to replace the insecure WEP. WPA used a 48-bit IV in place of WEP’s 24-bit IV. This upgraded IV uses a temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP). TKIP is an IEEE standard that was designed to provide more secure encryption. TKIP is a suite of \xa0 algorithms \xa0 that allows WLAN equipment to upgrade to TKIP without replacing hardware. TKIP encrypts each data \xa0 packet \xa0 with a unique encryption \xa0 key , and the keys are much stronger than WEP. To increase key strength, TKIP includes four additional algorithms. \n 引入了WPA標準來代替不安全的WEP。 WPA使用48位IV代替了WEP的24位IV。此升級的IV使用臨時密鑰完整性協議（TKIP）。 TKIP是旨在提供更安全的加密的IEEE標準。 TKIP是一套算法，可以使WLAN設備升級到TKIP，而無需更換硬件。 TKIP使用唯一的加密密鑰對每個數據包進行加密，並且該密鑰比WEP強得多。為了增強按鍵強度，TKIP包括四個附加算法。 \n In addition to TKIP, the WPA standard uses message integrity check (MIC) to confirm that data was not modified in transit. MIC uses a “hash” to verify that a message has not been altered. WPA supported both preshared key mode and enterprise mode. In enterprise mode, users are required to authenticate before exchanging their keys and each key between the client and access point is only temporary, reducing the chance of compromise. Unfortunately, WPA also suffered security flaws centered on the use of passphrases and pre-shared key (PSK) management and is now also considered to be unsecure. \n 除了TKIP，WPA標準還使用消息完整性檢查（MIC）來確認數據在傳輸過程中沒有被修改。 MIC使用“哈希”來驗證消息是否未被更改。 WPA支持預共享密鑰模式和企業模式。在企業模式下，要求用戶在交換密鑰之前進行身份驗證，並且客戶端和訪問點之間的每個密鑰只是臨時的，從而減少了洩露的機會。不幸的是，WPA還遭受了圍繞密碼短語和預共享密鑰（PSK）管理的安全缺陷，現在也被認為是不安全的。 \n Wi-Fi Protected Access2(WPA2) \n Wi-Fi protected access version 2 (WPA2) was implemented to replace both WEP and WPA because of the insecurities with the 24-bit and 48-bit initialization vectors. WPA2 requires stronger encryption and integrity checking, using counter mode (CCMP) with cipher block chaining message authentication code protocol for integrity checking. Additionally, the encryption used for WPA2 is the advanced encryption standard (AES) with a 128-bit key, the same algorithm used by the United States government to protect their classified networks. Using WPA2 creates a secure wireless network, but only when used with good passwords and shared keys. WPA2 also supports enterprise mode for centralized user authentication (used in corporate networks) and a personal mode for preshared key support (used in most homes and small offices). The key to security with WPA2 is a strong password, since the current method of breaking into a WPA2 network is to use brute force attacks against the preshared key. If your key is long and complex, the attackers will not be able to penetrate your WPA2 wireless networks. \n 由於24位和48位初始化向量的不安全性，實施了Wi-Fi保護訪問版本2（WPA2）來替代WEP和WPA。 WPA2需要使用計數器模式（CCMP）和密碼塊鏈接消息身份驗證代碼協議進行更強的加密和完整性檢查，以進行完整性檢查。此外，用於WPA2的加密是具有128位密鑰的高級加密標準（AES），與美國政府用於保護其機密網絡的算法相同。使用WPA2可以創建安全的無線網絡，但前提是要使用良好的密碼和共享密鑰。 WPA2還支持用於集中式用戶身份驗證的企業模式（用於公司網絡）和用於預共享密鑰支持的個人模式（用於大多數家庭和小型辦公室）。使用WPA2進行安全保護的密鑰是一個強密碼，因為當前闖入WPA2網絡的方法是對預共享密鑰使用暴力攻擊。如果密鑰又長又復雜，攻擊者將無法穿透您的WPA2無線網絡。 \n Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 Enterprise \n WPA2 enterprise is a client/server model using the remote authentication dial-in user service (RADIUS) protocol found in larger corporate networks. The RADIUS server runs in the application layer using UDP (user datagram protocol) as a transport method, and is usually a software background service running on a UNIX or Windows server. WPA2 enterprise eliminates a shared key and replaces it with a username and a password to connect to the corporate Wi-Fi network. \n WPA2企業版是使用大型企業網絡中使用的遠程身份驗證撥入用戶服務（RADIUS）協議的客戶端/服務器模型。 RADIUS服務器使用UDP（用戶數據報協議）作為傳輸方法在應用程序層中運行，通常是在UNIX或Windows服務器上運行的軟件後台服務。 WPA2企業消除了共享密鑰，並將其替換為用戶名和密碼以連接到公司的Wi-Fi網絡。 \n Click \xa0 here \xa0 to access a table of 802.11 wireless networking standards. \n 單擊此處以訪問802.11無線網絡標準表。 \n Wireless Networking Types \n learning objective-學習目標 \n 1.Compare wireless network standards, encryption, and interfaces.（比較無線網絡標準，加密和接口） \n 2.Configure a wireless connection.（配置無線連接） \n In addition to Wi-Fi networks, there are other wireless options that exist, such as Bluetooth and infrared. These types of technologies are usually used for Personal Area Networks (PANs) in order to connect (or pair) two devices in an ad hoc manner. \n 除了Wi-Fi網絡外，還存在其他無線選項，例如藍牙和紅外線。這些類型的技術通常用於個人區域網（PAN），以便以臨時方式連接（或配對）兩個設備。 \n Bluetooth radio is used to connect many kinds of devices, including mice, keyboards, remotes, smartphones, tablets, printers, projectors, and many others. Just as USB replaced most cables between devices and the workstation, Bluetooth replaces most previous wireless technologies for personal area networks (like infrared). Bluetooth does not require direct line of sight between connected devices. Bluetooth is a low-speed, short-range networking technology that comes in three classes. Class 1, which is not common, can transmit up to 100 meters. Class 2, the most common Bluetooth in use today, can travel up to 10 meters. Class 3, a very short-range variant, only goes one meter. Bluetooth can operate at up to three Mbps, which in today’s modern computer networks is considered extremely slow. \n 藍牙無線電用於連接多種設備，包括滑鼠，鍵盤，遙控器，智能手機，平板電腦，打印機，投影機等。就像USB取代了設備與工作站之間的大多數電纜一樣，藍牙也取代了個人區域網（例如紅外線）中以前的大多數無線技術。 藍牙不需要所連接設備之間的直接視線 。 藍牙是一種低速，短距離網絡技術 ，分為三類。 1級（不常見）可以傳輸100米。第2類，是當今使用的最常見的藍牙，可以傳輸10米。 3級是一種非常短距離的變體，只能行駛一米。藍牙可以以高達3 Mbps的速度運行，在當今的現代計算機網絡中，這被認為是非常慢的。 \n Infrared existed before Bluetooth and was a short-range, low-speed, line-of-sight communication path. It was heavily used to connect personal digital assistants (PDAs) and wireless mice and keyboards. Not common in contemporary computers, it was replaced almost entirely by Bluetooth, but some machines keep an integrated infrared sensor for backward compatibility. If you have a need for infrared, but it isn’t included on your machine, you can add an infrared sensor through a USB adapter. \n 紅外技術早於藍牙技術就已存在，它是一種短距離，低速，視線通信的路徑 。它被大量用於連接個人數字助理（PDA）和無線滑鼠和鍵盤。在當代計算機中並不常見，它幾乎已完全被藍牙取代，但某些機器保留了集成的紅外傳感器以實現向後兼容性。 如果您需要紅外線，但您的機器中沒有紅外線，則可以通過USB適配器添加紅外線傳感器。 \n \n Bluetooth logo.

Essentially, this connectivity provides our link to the wide area network (WAN). Each type of connection has benefits and drawbacks, so it is important that you, as a technician, understand which WAN connectivity method you should use in a given scenario. Also, we will cover the basic methods of connecting a small office/home office (SOHO) network, to include wireless devices and connection to the Internet. \n 在本模塊中，我們將討論網絡的各種類型的Internet連接。本質上，這種連通性提供了我們到廣域網（WAN）的鏈接。每種類型的連接都有其優點和缺點，因此，作為一名技術人員，了解在給定方案中應使用哪種WAN連接方法非常重要。此外，我們還將介紹連接小型辦公室/家庭辦公室（SOHO）網絡的基本方法，包括無線設備和與Internet的連接。 \n Networking Internet Connectivity \n learning objective-學習目標 \n Compare and contrast Internet connection types and features.（比較和對比Internet連接類型和功能） \n The oldest method of Internet connectivity is the dial-up network, usually abbreviated as DUN. Dial-up networking uses the public telephone lines using an analog audible signal over the line, which provides a maximum speed of 56 Kbps. The public switched telephone network (PSTN) is made up of multiple telephone carriers from around the world. Analog connections (voice and data) using the PSTN are called plain old telephone service (POTS) connections. To connect to the Internet using POTS, you needed both a modem and a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) to answer your dial-up call. \n 最早的Internet連接方法是撥號網絡，通常縮寫為DUN。撥號網絡使用公用電話線，該公用電話線在線路上使用模擬聲音信號，最大速度為56 Kbps。公共交換電話網（PSTN）由來自世界各地的多個電話運營商組成。使用PSTN的模擬連接（語音和數據）稱為普通舊電話服務（POTS）連接。要使用POTS連接到Internet，您需要數據機和撥號Internet服務提供商（ISP）來應答您的撥號電話。 \n A modem is a device that converts 1s and 0s from their digital state into an audible state that is transferred over a standard telephone line. Modem stands for modulate/demodulate, which is the process of the digital data being converted to/from analog for transmission. Modems can reside in or be connected to computers in multiple ways, including: \n 數據機是一種將1和0從其數字狀態轉換為可聽狀態的設備，該狀態可通過標準電話線傳輸。數據機代表調製/解調，調製/解調是將數字數據轉換為模擬量/從模擬量轉換為傳輸的過程。數據機可以多種方式駐留在計算機中或連接到計算機，包括： \n \n Add-on card (like PCI or PCIe) （ 附加卡 \xa0 PCI:外部連結標準PCIe:匯流排規格 ） \n Externally connected by USB and/or serial （通過USB和/或串行外部連接 ） \n PC card (for laptops) （ PC卡（用於筆記本電腦）） \n Integrated in the motherboard （集成在主板上 ） \n Mini-PCI （微型PCI ） \n Mini-PCIe card (internal for laptops) （ Mini-PCIe卡（筆記本電腦內部）） \n \n While dial-up modems were extremely popular at the dawn of the Internet in the 1980s and 1990s, the bandwidth limitation of 56 Kbps quickly become an issue as faster alternatives were sought. Eventually dial-up modems were replaced, and now they are almost nonexistent. \n 儘管撥號數據機在1980年代和1990年代互聯網興起之初非常受歡迎，但隨著人們尋求更快的替代方案，56 Kbps的帶寬限制迅速成為一個問題。最終，撥號數據機被替換了，現在它們幾乎不存在了。 \n Dial-up modem.

ISDN supports multiple 64 Kbps channels over a single connection. These 64-Kbps channels are called bearer channels (B channels). ISDN provides faster speeds than dial-up, usually at 128 Kbps, and also provides an “always on” connection, instead of “on demand” (like dial-up service). ISDN was a popular alternative to DUN in the 1980s for government, corporate, and educational networks, but was too cost prohibitive for the consumer market. ISDN was one of the first “high-speed” options available to carry voice, video, or data. ISDN requires an ISDN terminal adapter, which can be internal or external and acts like a “modem” for the ISDN circuit. It takes two or more RJ-11 phone lines and binds them together to provide the desired data rate. The primary rate interface (PRI) has a maximum speed of 1.536 Mbps, but the most common ISDN service is basic rate interface, which provides either 64 Kbps (single) or 128 Kbps (double) rate service. While this is an older technology, ISDN is still entrenched in some of the larger government and educational networks because it is cost prohibitive to remove it entirely. Most entities have moved to broadband solutions such as voice over IP (VoIP) using session initiation protocol (SIP) trunks. In the next session, we will discuss the next generation of broadband data solutions. Currently, Internet protocol video teleconference (IPVT) has become more widespread and cost efficient. \n 整合服務數位網絡（ISDN）的速度比基本撥號更快。 ISDN通過單個連接支持多個64 Kbps通道。這些64 Kbps通道稱為承載通道（B通道）。 ISDN通常以128 Kbps的速度提供比撥號更快的速度，並且還提供“始終在線”連接，而不是“按需”連接（例如撥號服務）。對於政府，企業和教育網絡，ISDN在1980年代是DUN的一種流行替代方法，但對於消費者市場而言，成本太高了。 ISDN是最早可用於傳輸語音，視頻或數據的“高速”選項之一。 ISDN需要ISDN終端適配器，該適配器可以是內部或外部的，並且充當ISDN電路的“數據機”。它需要兩條或多條RJ-11電話線並將它們綁在一起以提供所需的數據速率。主速率接口（PRI）的最大速度為1.536 Mbps，但是最常見的ISDN服務是基本速率接口，它提供64 Kbps（單速率）或128 Kbps（雙速率）服務。儘管這是一種較舊的技術，但ISDN在某些較大的政府和教育網絡中仍然根深蒂固，因為完全刪除它的成本高昂。大多數實體已轉向使用會話發起協議（SIP）中繼的IP語音（VoIP）等寬帶解決方案。在下屆會議上，我們將討論下一代寬帶數據解決方案。當前，互聯網協議視頻電話會議（IPVT）已經變得更加普及和具有成本效益。 \n \n Ucom Omni TA128 ISDN terminal adapter. Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from \xa0 Martin Bekkelund . \n One of the first consumer replacements for dial-up service was the digital subscriber line (DSL). DSL solved the 56.6 Kbps limitation of DUN and effectively began the consumer broadband demand for greater Internet speeds. DSL utilizes the existing POTS network that already exists at homes and offices and allows the digital signal to piggyback on the normal analog phone line. DSL is referred to as xDSL with two main varieties: asymmetric DSL (ADSL) and symmetric DSL (SDSL). Other variants of xDSL include high-bit-rate DSL (HDSL); symmetric high-speed DSL (SHDSL), which is a form of symmetric DSL; and very-high-bit-rate DSL second-generation (VDSL2), a form of ADSL using combined fiber optics with copper to achieve greater speeds. ADSL provides high-speed Internet with a faster download speed than its upload speed. Download speeds are between 384 Kbps and 24 Mbps, but uploads are only 128 Kbps to 3.3 Mbps. It was marketed to home users and small businesses, who utilize the Internet primarily as a consumption network, downloading much more information than they upload. For example, if you go to a streaming video site and request a video, your request may only be a few hundred kilobytes. But, the video you receive back (download) is several hundred megabytes. This is the typical web surfing pattern of most users, so ADSL worked well for the majority of people. \n 撥號服務的第一個消費者替代產品是數字用戶線（DSL）。 DSL解決了DUN的56.6 Kbps限制，並有效地開始了消費者寬帶對更高互聯網速度的需求。 DSL利用家庭和辦公室中已經存在的現有POTS網絡，並允許數字信號搭載在普通的模擬電話線上。 DSL被稱為xDSL，主要有兩種：非對稱DSL（ADSL）和對稱DSL（SDSL）。 xDSL的其他變體包括高比特率DSL（HDSL）；對稱高速DSL（SHDSL），是對稱DSL的一種形式；第二種是非常高比特率的DSL（VDSL2），它是一種結合了銅纜和光纖以達到更高速度的ADSL。 ADSL為高速Internet提供比其上載速度更快的下載速度。下載速度介於384 Kbps和24 Mbps之間，而上傳速度僅為128 Kbps至3.3 Mbps。它面向的是家庭用戶和小型企業，他們主要將互聯網用作消費網絡，下載的信息比上傳的信息多得多。例如，如果您訪問流媒體視頻站點並請求視頻，那麼您的請求可能只有幾百千字節。但是，您收到的視頻（下載）為數百兆字節。這是大多數用戶的典型網絡衝浪模式，因此ADSL對於大多數人來說效果很好。 \n SDSL, on the other hand, matches the download and upload speeds. Since more bandwidth is dedicated to the upload side, speed is lost on the download side. Speed ranges from 384 Kbps to 2 Mbps for both upload and download. This was used heavily in commercial scenarios, where clients need higher upload speeds due to their business models. The biggest disadvantage of xDSL is that it is distance-dependent from the telephone company switching station or central office (CO) — the further from the CO, the greater the attenuation (signal loss) and thus the slower the speed. However, telephone companies (sometimes referred to as telco) are adding DSL loop extenders and combining fiber optics with xDSL to overcome this limitation. \n 另一方面，SDSL與下載和上傳速度匹配。由於更多的帶寬專用於上載側，因此速度在下載側上損失了。上傳和下載的速度範圍從384 Kbps到2 Mbps。這在商業場景中被大量使用，在商業場景中，客戶由於其業務模型而需要更高的上載速度。 xDSL的最大缺點是，它與電話公司的交換台或中心局（CO）之間的距離取決於-與CO的距離越遠，衰減（信號損耗）越大，因此速度越慢。但是，電話公司（有時稱為telco）正在添加DSL環路擴展器，並將光纖與xDSL組合在一起以克服此限制。 \n Cable, the second broadband solution for Internet connectivity, developed concurrently with DSL throughout the 1990s. Cable providers, like the telephone companies, had an immense infrastructure of wiring available as the broadband market grew. Remember that early LANs used coaxial cable prior to Ethernet, and the outgrowth to Internet connectivity using this infrastructure was natural. Cable television infrastructure contains both coaxial and fiber-optic cabling, which is called a hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) distribution network. Cable Internet provides homes and businesses with Internet service delivered over the existing coaxial cables in their area at a reasonable rate. Speeds ranging from 15/2 Mbps (download/upload speed) to 60/6 Mbps are now common with cable service, with some companies also adding fiber to their infrastructure, allowing them to achieve speeds greater than 100 Mbps downstream. Updated cable modems (DOCSIS 3.0) combined with wireless router specifications (AC3200) play an important role in achieving the package speeds Internet service providers (ISPs) advertise to their customers. Like xDSL, cable broadband has its own unique disadvantages. Specific frequency ranges are used for upstream (uploading) and downstream (downloading) data transmission, and all customers share a single hybrid fiber-coax hub, which means that bandwidth speeds fluctuate throughout the day during peak times when many neighbors are online. Fiber-optic and DSL networks do not suffer from this inconsistent data stream. Further, many companies are beginning to cap data usage and bill customers for over-usage. This can cause low speed during peak usage times, whereas true fiber and DSL networks provide a steady service capability that cable cannot. \n 電纜是第二個用於Internet連接的寬帶解決方案，在整個1990年代與DSL同時開發。像電話公司一樣，電纜提供商也隨著寬帶市場的增長而擁有龐大的佈線基礎設施。請記住，早期的LAN先於以太網使用同軸電纜，並且使用此基礎架構向Internet連接的擴展自然而然。有線電視基礎設施同時包含同軸電纜和光纖電纜，這稱為混合光纖同軸（HFC）分配網絡。 Cable Internet為家庭和企業提供合理的速率，通過其所在地區的現有同軸電纜提供Internet服務。電纜服務現在的速度範圍從15/2 Mbps（下載/上傳速度）到60/6 Mbps，一些公司還向其基礎架構中添加了光纖，從而使下行速度達到了100 Mbps以上。更新的電纜調製解調器（DOCSIS 3.0）與無線路由器規範（AC3200）的結合在實現Internet服務提供商（ISP）向其客戶做廣告的打包速度方面起著重要作用。像xDSL一樣，有線寬帶也有其獨特的缺點。特定的頻率範圍用於上游（上傳）和下游（下載）數據傳輸，並且所有客戶共享一個混合光纖同軸集線器，這意味著在許多鄰居在線的高峰時段，帶寬速度全天都會波動。光纖和DSL網絡不會受到這種不一致的數據流的影響。此外，許多公司開始限制數據使用量並向客戶收取過度使用費用。這可能會在高峰使用時間內導致低速運行，而真正的光纖和DSL網絡提供了電纜無法提供的穩定服務能力。 \n \n Cable modem. Photo used under CC-BY-SA license from\xa0 Paul Boxley . \n The newest broadband solution providing Internet connectivity to homes and businesses is the fiber-optic network. A great example of this is Fios from Verizon, although Google Fiber is now entering this market, as well. In these networks, the company provides a fiber-optic cable to your residence or office that is terminated in a fiber-optic modem. This utilizes light over a long piece of glass cabling to provide the signal to and from the data centers. Service is exceptionally good, with very high speeds of up to 150 Mbps downloads or more. Upload speeds can also be extremely fast, reaching 35 Mbps or higher. \n 提供到家庭和企業Internet連接的最新寬帶解決方案是光纖網絡。一個很好的例子是Verizon的Fios，儘管Google Fiber現在也正在進入這個市場。在這些網絡中，公司為您的住宅或辦公室提供了一條光纖電纜，並以光纖調製解調器端接。這利用了較長的玻璃電纜上的光來提供往返數據中心的信號。服務異常出色，下載速度高達150 Mbps或更高。上傳速度也可以非常快，達到35 Mbps或更高。 \n \n Glass fibers. Photo used under CC-BY license from\xa0 Roshan Nikam . \n A major disadvantage all the aforementioned broadband solutions share is availability in rural and small towns where the infrastructure does not exist. In spite of the FCC’s Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan, developed as directed under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, there are still many areas in the United States and throughout the world that lack Internet access. Therefore, a satellite WAN connection might be an option for those requiring faster Internet service but who lack the infrastructure to receive it from the telephone or cable companies. Satellite Internet can provide fast speeds like a DSL modem, but contains low bandwidth usage limits with high costs for over-the-limit usage. Satellite tends to be an expensive option in comparison to cable and DSL service, but is often the only option in remote areas. There are two potential design problems that should be considered when using satellite service: delay and weather conditions. First, the service provided by satellite has a high delay and lag time compared to more traditional Internet options. This lag time is because the signal has to travel from your satellite dish to the satellite, then to the ground station, and return through the same path. This travel time requires nearly half a second for a roundtrip to occur, because the satellite is in orbit at 22,000 miles above the earth. Second, the weather can affect your service. Just like when you watch satellite television during a thunderstorm or heavy snow, satellite Internet can be disconnected due to heavy weather conditions. \n 所有上述寬帶解決方案共享的主要缺點是在不存在基礎設施的農村和小城鎮中的可用性。儘管FCC的“連通美國：國家寬帶計劃”是根據2009年《美國復甦和再投資法案》制定的，但美國和世界各地仍有許多地區缺乏Internet訪問。因此，對於那些需要更快的Internet服務但又缺乏從電話或電纜公司那裡接收Internet的基礎設施的用戶來說，可以使用衛星WAN連接。衛星Internet可以像DSL調製解調器一樣提供更快的速度，但是包含較低的帶寬使用限制以及超限使用的高成本。與電纜和DSL服務相比，衛星往往是昂貴的選擇，但通常是偏遠地區的唯一選擇。使用衛星服務時，應考慮兩個潛在的設計問題：延遲和天氣狀況。首先，與傳統互聯網選項相比，衛星提供的服務具有較高的延遲和延遲時間。該滯後時間是因為信號必須從衛星天線傳播到衛星，然後再傳播到地面站，然後通過同一路徑返回。由於衛星在離地球22,000英里的軌道上運行，因此往返所需的時間將近半秒。其次，天氣會影響您的服務。就像在雷雨或大雪期間觀看衛星電視一樣，由於惡劣的天氣，衛星互聯網可能會斷開連接。 \n \n Satellite dish. Photo used under CC-BY license from\xa0 Alan Levine . \n The last broadband solution is Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), which uses microwave towers to provide fixed wireless access connectivity similar to Wi-Fi but with a larger geographical coverage connecting directly to metropolitan area networks (MANs). Following the IEEE 802.16 standard, WiMAX operates on a different radio frequency than Wi-Fi and can be used to connect businesses to a MAN as well as individual subscribers to the Internet through an ISP. Providing up to 70 Mbps, WiMAX can provide coverage to rural areas, like satellite does, but at a lesser cost and with more reliability. Distance is another factor, because within three miles (nearly five kilometers) users can connect using a wireless WiMAX device similar to a Wi-Fi access point, but greater than that distance requires a “line of sight” antenna. \n 最新的寬帶解決方案是全球微波訪問互操作性（WiMAX），它使用微波塔提供類似於Wi-Fi的固定無線訪問連接，但是地理覆蓋範圍更大，可以直接連接到城域網（MAN）。遵循IEEE 802.16標準，WiMAX的工作頻率與Wi-Fi的無線電頻率不同，可用於將企業連接到MAN以及將單個訂戶通過ISP連接到Internet。 WiMAX可以提供高達70 Mbps的速度，可以像衛星一樣向農村地區提供覆蓋，但是成本更低，可靠性更高。距離是另一個因素，因為用戶可以在三英里（近五公里）內使用類似於Wi-Fi接入點的無線WiMAX設備進行連接，但距離超過該距離則需要“視線”天線。 \n The WiMAX Forum is a consortium comprised of industry leaders dedicated to ensure compatibility and interoperability within the specification. WiMAX is leveraged to serve municipalities and specialized communication structures such as the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS). \n WiMAX論壇是一個由行業領導者組成的聯盟，致力於確保規範內的兼容性和互操作性。 WiMAX被用於服務市政當局和專用通信結構，例如航空移動機場通信系統（AeroMACS）。 \n Another option for Internet connectivity, and by far the newest for mobile Internet connectivity, is cellular networks. In order to access the cellular network, you must use a cellular modem. Cellular modems come in a variety of models, including internal (mini PCIe) cards for laptops, USB external modem sticks, and Wi-Fi devices (like cellphones or MiFi units). Cellular modems operate at speeds up to 4G (100 Mbps) wherever cellular service exists. If 4G is not available, the cellular modems are backward compatible with the older networks such as 3G at 800 Kbps and 2G at 56 Kbps speeds. \n 蜂窩網絡是Internet連接的另一種選擇，也是迄今為止最新的移動Internet連接。為了訪問蜂窩網絡，必須使用蜂窩調製解調器。蜂窩調製解調器有多種型號，包括用於筆記本電腦的內部（微型PCIe）卡，USB外部調製解調器棒和Wi-Fi設備（例如手機或MiFi設備）。蜂窩調製解調器在任何存在蜂窩服務的地方都可以高達4G（100 Mbps）的速度運行。如果無法使用4G，則蜂窩調製解調器將與較早的網絡向後兼容，例如800 Kbps的3G和56 Kbps的速度的2G。 \n Smartphones can now be turned into wireless hotspots through tethering. With tethering, the phone acts like a cellular modem for a tablet or computer. You can connect devices to the cell phone through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or the USB port and then out to the Internet through the cellular network. The only requirement is that the smartphone has Wi-Fi capability. \n 現在，可以通過網絡共享將智能手機變成無線熱點。通過網絡共享，電話就像平板電腦或計算機的蜂窩調製解調器一樣。您可以通過藍牙，Wi-Fi或USB端口將設備連接到手機，然後通過蜂窩網絡連接到Internet。唯一的要求是智能手機必須具有Wi-Fi功能。 \n Due to the underlying infrastructure, 4G data speed is significantly greater than 3G. Until 2015, the infrastructure was either mobile WiMax or LTE. Mobile WiMAX was adopted by Sprint, Intel, and other industry leaders to be the next generation for cellular carriers. While some mobile carriers invested and developed access through mobile WiMAX, others backed 4G LTE, which progressed from the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) standard. Both standards, as with all cellular networking, are incredibly sensitive to distance from carrier towers. As of March 2016, Mobile WiMAX lost the backing of Sprint when they shut down their mobile WiMAX network, and it appears that LTE will be the infrastructure supporting 4G. \n 由於具有基礎架構，因此4G數據速度明顯高於3G。直到2015年，基礎設施還是移動WiMax或LTE。移動WiMAX被Sprint，英特爾和其他行業領導者採用，成為蜂窩運營商的下一代產品。一些移動運營商通過移動WiMAX投資並開發了接入服務，而其他移動運營商則支持從全球移動通信系統（GSM）標準發展而來的4G LTE。與所有蜂窩網絡一樣，這兩個標準對與運營商塔樓的距離都非常敏感。截至2016年3月，移動WiMAX在關閉其移動WiMAX網絡時失去了Sprint的支持，並且看來LTE將成為支持4G的基礎架構。 \n A standard under development and expected to be released sometime in the early 2020s is 5G. The premise of this standard is that Internet connectivity has become more of a requirement than a luxury. Although the cellular market has moved away from mobile WiMAX, the infrastructure is still available throughout the world for fixed wireless. The Internet of things (IoT) is a phrase used to describe the convergence that is taking place now in the 21st century, when any and all capable devices will be connected to the Internet. From smart homes and their subsystems, to appliances, to automobiles with Wi-Fi and GPS, users will be deriving benefits from broadband technologies and “always on” connectivity. The 5G standard and other major initiatives in the fiber-optic and Wi-Fi industries are promising to move toward that end. Groups such as the WiMAX Forum and many other industry leaders are heavily investing in bringing together device connectivity under the IoT umbrella. \n 5G是正在開發中的標準，預計將在2020年代初發布。該標準的前提是，Internet連接已成為一種需求，而非奢侈。儘管蜂窩市場已經脫離了移動WiMAX，但該基礎設施仍在全球範圍內用於固定無線。物聯網（IoT）是一個短語，用於描述21世紀當今正在發生的融合，屆時，任何功能強大的設備都將連接到Internet。從智能家居及其子系統，到家用電器，再到具有Wi-Fi和GPS的汽車，用戶將從寬帶技術和“始終在線”的連接中受益。光纖和Wi-Fi行業中的5G標準和其他主要舉措有望朝著這一目標邁進。 WiMAX論壇等組織和許多其他行業領導者正在大力投資，以在IoT框架下整合設備連接性。 \n As we previously mentioned, both cable and xDSL networks benefit by incorporating fiber into the back end (known as the backhaul ), which increases the overall bandwidth available to the customer. Another major benefit of fiber is its resistance to electromagnetic interference. \n 如前所述，電纜和xDSL網絡都受益於將光纖集成到後端（稱為回程）中，從而增加了可供客戶使用的整體帶寬。纖維的另一個主要優點是它具有抗電磁干擾的能力。 \n Setting up a NetWork \n learning objective-學習目標 \n Install, configure, deploy, and test a SOHO wireless/wired router using appropriate settings.（ 使用適當的設置安裝，配置，部署和測試SOHO無線/有線路由器） \n The first and probably the most important step in deploying a wireless network is the planning phase. A site survey is the process of evaluating a network solution to deliver the required coverage, data rates, network capacity, roaming capacity, and quality of service. \n 部署無線網絡的第一步也是最重要的一步是規劃階段。站點調查是評估網絡解決方案以提供所需覆蓋範圍，數據速率，網絡容量，漫遊容量和服務質量的過程。 \n Factors that affect the number of access points needed in a building include: \n 影響建築物所需接入點數量的因素包括： \n \n The size of the building. （ 建築物的大小。） \n The number and type of walls in the building and their composition. （ 建築物中牆壁的數量和類型及其組成。） \n The type of interference or obstructions between stations and the access point. （站點與接入點之間的干擾或障礙類型。 ） \n The presence of high-voltage equipment (microwaves, power transformers, air-conditioning/heating units, elevators, etc.). （存在高壓設備（微波爐，電源變壓器，空調/加熱裝置，電梯等）。 ） \n Existing wired and wireless implementations. （現有的有線和無線實現。 ） \n Bandwidth requirements. （帶寬要求。 ） \n \n To connect your device to the Internet, you need to have two things. First, you must have an Internet access device (or modem) such as we described in the previous section. This is really dependent on your requirements and the ISP choices where you are located. The Internet service provider (ISP) you choose will determine the type of modem you need and will supply the customer-premises equipment (CPE) for the outside of the building. Next, you must provide your network with a router, which serves as the interconnection point from your local area network clients (LAN) to the ISP external network (WAN). \n 要將設備連接到Internet，您需要做兩件事。首先，您必須具有上一節所述的Internet訪問設備（或調製解調器）。這實際上取決於您的要求和您所在位置的ISP選擇。您選擇的Internet服務提供商（ISP）將確定所需的調製解調器的類型，並將為建築物的外部提供客戶駐地設備（CPE）。接下來，您必須為網絡提供一個路由器，該路由器用作從局域網客戶端（LAN）到ISP外部網絡（WAN）的互連點。 \n There are really only 11 steps to set up a small office, home office (SOHO) network: \n 設置小型辦公室，家庭辦公室（SOHO）網絡實際上只有11個步驟： \n \n Decide on the type of Internet connection you will use. The ISP you choose will determine the type of modem you need and whether you buy or lease it. For a small office or home office, your most obvious choices will most likely be fiber, cable, or DSL, although a satellite, WiMAX, or cellular connection might be viable. （確定您將使用的Internet連接類型。您選擇的ISP將確定所需的調製解調器類型以及是否購買或租賃它。對於小型辦公室或家庭辦公室，儘管衛星，WiMAX或蜂窩連接可能可行，但最明顯的選擇很可能是光纖，電纜或DSL。 ） \n Determine how your workstations, often referred to as clients, will connect to the router. Will you use a wireless access point or wired Ethernet switch? （ 確定您的工作站（通常稱為客戶端）如何連接到路由器。您將使用無線接入點還是有線以太網交換機？） \n Choose the modem and router that will support your first two choices. （ 選擇將支持您的前兩個選擇的調製解調器和路由器。） \n Set up the account with the ISP. They will come to your location to set up the CPE, including any wiring to the location where you determine the modem is to be placed. Whether you chose to lease or buy your own modem, the ISP usually offers a service to set up the connection between the modem and your LAN router. You also have the option of installing it yourself. （ 使用ISP設置帳戶。他們將來到您的位置來設置CPE，包括到您確定要放置調製解調器的位置的任何佈線。無論您選擇租賃還是購買自己的調製解調器，ISP通常都會提供一項服務來建立調製解調器與LAN路由器之間的連接。您也可以選擇自己安裝它。 ） \n Cable the modem and router together. （ 將調製數據機和路由器連接在一起。） \n Configure the router and wireless access point (if used). （ 配置路由器和無線訪問點（如果使用）。） \n Connect each client to the network (cabled or wireless) and verify they are working properly. （ 將每個客戶端連接到網絡（電纜或無線），並驗證它們是否正常運行。） \n Configure each device to be part of the same workgroup or create a homegroup; this will allow you to configure each client to share resources like printers and file sharing. （ 將每個設備配置為同一工作組的一部分或創建一個家庭組；這將允許您配置每個客戶端以共享打印機和文件共享等資源。） \n Set up file and print sharing on each client designating which resources to share. （在每個客戶端上設置文件和打印共享，以指定要共享的資源。） \n Test each client to verify they can reach the Internet. （測試每個客戶端以驗證他們可以訪問Internet。 ） \n Test the resources you shared in step 9 to make sure they are connected. If everything is working, you have an effective, Internet-connected workgroup that can share resources internally, as well. （測試您在步驟9中共享的資源，以確保它們已連接。如果一切正常，您將擁有一個有效的，與Internet連接的工作組，該工作組也可以在內部共享資源。 ） \n \n As you can see, step six asks you to configure a wireless router.
